## *Story*

#### ***One day I saw a small snake in the compound.  It was crawling along slowly but when it saw me, it moved away quickly and hid itself in a coconut shell.  I quietly went near and closed the mouth of the coconut shell with a stone.  Then I took the shell and ran to Grandmother.“ Look, Grandma,” I cried, “ I have caught a snake.”“ Snake?” asked Grandmother in alarm. She was shocked.  She cried for help. Grandfather came running.  When he learnt that I had a snake in the shell, he snatched the shell and threw it away.The snake crawled away and disappeared behind some bushes.  Grandfather warned me never to go near a snake, because snakes were very dangerous.Later in the evening, I tried to catch a bee and it stung me on my finger.  I felt a sharp pain. I ran to grandmother and told her that I had been bitten and wanted her to do something to stop the pain.  Grandmother thought that I had been bitten by a snake.  She called out to Grandfather, “Come and see what has happened to Raja.”Grandfather came at once.  He looked at my finger and there was a blue mark.  Without a word he took me in his arms and started running.  He ran across the garden and through the paddy fields. He ran and ran and did not stop until he reached a small house quite some distance away from our home.  Then he shouted for the man who lived there. An old grey haired man came out of the house. He knew the cure for snake bite. Grandfather asked him to cure me.  The old man took me inside. He looked at my finger and then asked me to sit down and not to move.  I sat on Grandfather’s lap. The old man then took some water in a small brass vessel, sat in front of us and started reciting some mantras.I wanted to tell him that it was a bee and not a snake that had bitten me.  But Grandfather held me tight and did not allow me to talk. Grandmother too had arrived by then and some other people with her. They looked sad and silently watched me. “By this time the pain in my finger had stopped.  But still I had to sit there and get cured of ‘snakebite.’ After a few minutes, the old man got up, washed my finger and gave me some water to drink.  He asked me to keep quiet for some more time.  Then he turned to Grandfather and said, “Thank God, you brought Raja in time.  He is out of danger now.  It was indeed a poisonous snake that bit him.”Grandfather, Grandmother and all others thanked the old man for the magic cure.  On returning home, Grandfather sent him gifts.***

## LET US LEARN GRAMMAR
## Verb
**The Verb :** We can classify verbs as **regular verbs** and **irregular verbs**.

**Regular verbs**

* To form simple past tense verbs from simple present tense verbs we just add '-d' or '-ed' to the verb.

e.g. shock + ed = shocked
call + ed= called
reach + ed = reached
shout + ed = shouted
live + d = lived
dive + d = dived
like + d = liked
* These verbs are regular verbs because they have '-d' or '-ed' endings as a regular feature in the past tense.

**Irregular Verbs**

* All verbs do not take the 'd' or 'ed' endings to form the past tense. In some verbs there is a change in spellings in the past tense form 
### Examples:

| simple present tense | Simple past tense |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| take                 | took              |
| throw                | threw             |
| catch                | caught            |

* Given below are some more examples of irregular verbs:

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
| run | ran |
| hear | heard
| bring | brought
| buy | bought |
| deal | dealt |
| bind | bound |

* Some verbs remain the same in the past tense as they are in the present tense.
* Examples:
We put (simple present tense) some extra sugar in our tea.
I am sorry I put (simple past tense) salt instead of sugar yesterday.


## Adverbs

Read the following sentences.

* She **reads** the newspaper.
* She reads the newspaper **silently**.

In the first sentence **reads** is an action word (verb).
In the second sentence **silently** tells us how she reads i.e. it tells us something more about the verb. It is an adverb.

As you know verbs are action words. Adverbs are words that tell us something more about verbs.


Read the following sentences.

* He speaks **loudly**.
* She walks **slowly**.
* She dresses up **beautifully**.
* He walks **fast**.

The bold words are adverbs

Usually adverbs are formed by adding 'ly' to adjectives.

Examples:
* loud + ly = loudly
* slow + ly = slowly
* beautiful + ly = beautifully

However, some adverbs are exceptions to this rule. We do not add 'ly' to some adjectives to make adverbs. For example we say 'I walk **fast**'. We do not say 'I walk **fastly**'.

-----

## *Story*


#### ***Ram asked his army to build a bridge over the sea. Work began at once on a stone bridge. The monkeys pulled out rocks and heavy stones from the mountains, and carried them to the sea. They cut them into shape and began to build the bridge. All this was very difficult.work and it took a long time. Thousands of monkeys worked night and day. Rama felt happy. “How hard they work! Their love for me makes them work like this,” thought Rama.One day Rama saw a small brown squirrel. He was going up and down the seashore with little pebbles in his mouth. The little squirrel could carry only little pebbles at a time in his small mouth. He carried the pebbles from the seashore and dropped them into the sea. A great monkey was carrying a large heavy stone on his back and the squirrel came in his way. The monkey jumped back.“Here, you little thing,” shouted the monkey in a voice like thunder, “you’re in my way, I stepped back and you’re alive now. But I nearly fell. And what are you doing here?”The little squirrel looked up at the great monkey.I’m sorry you nearly fell, Brother Monkey,” he said in his small voice, “but please always look where you are going. I’m helping Rama build the bridge. And I want to work hard for him.”“You, what?” shouted the monkey and laughed aloud. “Did you hear that!” he said to the other monkeys. “The squirrel is building a bridge with his pebbles. Oh dear! Oh dear! I’ve never heard a funnier story.” The other monkeys laughed too.The squirrel did not think this funny at all. He said, “Look, I can’t carry mountains or rocks. God gave me only a little strength. I can only carry pebbles. My heart cries out for Rama and I’ll do all I can for him.”The monkeys said, “Don’t be foolish. Do you think you can help Rama? Do you think we can build a bridge with pebbles? He has a big army to help him. Go home and don’t get in our way.”“But I want to help, too,” said the squirrel and would not go.He carried the pebbles again from the shore to the sea. The monkeys were angry and one of them picked up the squirrel by his tail and threw him far away.The squirrel, crying out the name of Rama, fell into his hands.Then Rama held the squirrel close to him. He said to the monkeys, “Do not make fun of the weak and the small. Your strength or what you do is not important. What matters is your love. This little squirrel has love in his heart.”He then held the squirrel closer to him and said, “Little one, your love touches my heart.” He said these words and passed his fingers gently over the little squirrel’s back. And when he put him down there were three white stripes on his back. These were the marks of Lord Rama’s fingers.From then on the squirrel carries the three white stripes on his back.***

### **adjectives**

- To describe any person, place or thing, adjectives are used to tell their size, colour, age, origin, etc. When two or more than two adjectives are used before a noun, they are usually used in the following order:

| opinion | size | shape | age | colour | origin | material | noun |
|---------|------|-------|-----|--------|--------|----------|------|
|         |      |       | old |        | oil    |          | paintings |
|         | small| round |     |        |        | wooden   | box  |
| lovely  |      |       |     | black  |        | leather  | coat |
| delicious|     |       |     |        | Indian |          | food |

- Numbers go before adjectives. Example: three white stripes
- If there are more than two adjectives, a comma is usually used between them.

## *Story*
#### ***Kondiba Gaikwad hated begging. But the famine in Maharashtra in 1972-73 had driven him from his home in Aurangabad to Mumbai in search of bread At first, he had tried selling brooms. Unfortunately, he had little luck selling his goods. He soon learnt that Mumbai is generous to beggars - especially blind beggars. And 25-year-old Kondiba was blind. He had become blind with small pox at the age of eight. It was a cloudy day in “Golibar”, the large slum colony in Ghatkopar, north-east of Mumbai. Kondiba lived here with Tukaram and Tukaram’s wife, Yelanbai. It was the end of the monsoon. In the middle of an open area, in the colony there was a well. It was full of blackish-green water. Nothing could be seen more than a few centimetres below the surface.The well was highly useful to the people who lived in the surrounding huts. They had dug it two years before because the only water tap in the colony was not enough for the slum’s growing population. There had never been any money for a wall around the well. The mouth of the well had gradually widened as the soil and rocks on the sides fell in. The bottom was narrow, muddy and filled with weeds. The well was dangerous; but it had “been there for so long that no one worried about it. It seemed harmless. Kondiba had returned to the slum to eat a little food, which Yelanbai had prepared. His day’s begging usually ended when he had collected Rs. 5 to Rs. 6 in his small gunny bag.Suddenly, there were shouts and sounds of great confusion. Kondiba and Yelanbai were startled, “Someone’s fallen in the well!” they heard a woman cry.Kondiba set aside his meal and said urgently, “Quick, lead me there.” Within a minute the blind beggar and the woman reached the well, and pushed their way through a small group at the mouth of the well. In seconds Kondiba pulled off his shirt and slipped into the water. Two boys were already paddling around trying to find young Arvind, who had fallen off a tree trunk while drawing water. The boys could not dive.Kondiba had been a good swimmer as a young boy before he lost his sight. But years of poverty had made him weak. Once he had been able to dive deep into the wells around his village to pick up shining bits of broken pottery that he and his friends would throw in as “part of a game. But it had been many years since he had tried to hold his breath long enough to get to the bottom of a well.Kondiba floated on the surface for a moment, then took a deep breath and dived. Carefully feeling his way along the rocks on the side of well, he reached the bottom; his feet sank into the soft mud. He felt nothing but the mud and the slippery weeds. Tired, and with his breath running out, he came to the surface. It was now two minutes since Arvind had fallen in. His aunt, with whom he lived, was at the well. As Kondiba surfaced without the boy he heard her wailing.The blind man took another deep breath and vanished into the muddy depths. His first dive had given him a good idea of the shape of the well. So he went straight down and tried to search the bottom with his hands. They slipped in the mud and got caught in the weeds. There was still no sign of the boy.His lungs were nearly bursting. He rose to the top once again. “He had been down longer than the first time, so the women and children were getting more and more excited. When his head appeared above the water, the crowd gave a sigh of disappointment.Never in all the years of his blindness had Kondiba missed his vision so much. If only he could see, he might be able to find the drowning boy. He did not know that even normal eyes would never have been able to see in muddy water.Kondiba was very tired, but he knew he was Arvind’s only hope. He worked as fast as he could, feeling his way through the mud and the weeds. “Arvind must be here,” he thought. “He cannot have vanished.”Kondiba’s ribs were aching; he couldn’t hold his breath much longer. Then, just as he was about to twist his body upright and kick himself to the surface, his finger felt something soft among the weeds. Cloth! He moved his hand further and touched Arvind’s legs. The boy’s body was held in the mud and weeds. Kondiba’s heart was beating painfully, he badly needed to breathe. He felt desperately for something to hold in order to pull Arvind up and out of the net he was in. Suddenly, he felt Arvind's belt! Holding it tightly with his right hand, he pulled the lad free, turned about and pushed up. His spine and muscles ached. This almost stopped his movements. His weak, starved body fought against what his mind told him he must do.Keeping a tight hold on the boy’s belt, Kondiba struggled to push himself upwards with his free hand and feet.It seemed a long time before he rose the six metres from the bottom and broke surface. While he gasped for breath, other hands quickly lifted Arvind up and out of the well. Kondiba held on to the well’s rocky side, his eyes closed, his body tired. He heard, but paid little attention to the sounds of people trying to give Arvind artificial respiration. Finally, the boy began to vomit water, and cries to joy came to Kondiba still holding tightly to the side of the well.Then Arvind was hurried away to the hospital. Aman helped Kondiba out of the well and a woman “patted him affectionately on the shoulder. Yelanbai led him back to the hut. There, Kondiba put on his clothes, finished his half-eaten meal, and fell asleep.That evening, a police officer came to tell the blind beggar that the boy he had saved would be alright. Kondiba later learnt that if the boy had been in the well longer his brain would certainly have been damaged from lack of oxygen. And Kondiba had saved him just in time.The next afternoon, Arvind returned to “Golibar”. He went at once to Kondiba and, while his aunt watched with tears in her eyes, he touched Kondiba’s feet in gratitude.Indeed, Kondiba had saved a life. But his own still had to go on. and for him that meant begging. By afternoon Kondiba was back on the streets of Mumbai with his gunnysack. However, word soon began to spread about the beggar’s courage. His picture and the story of his daring rescue were published in many national and local papers. Suddenly Kondiba became a hero. He was praised by the Governor, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, “and other officials. Rewards totalling Rs. 12,970 were presented to him. For a few months, he was given a home in a Home for the Blind. Here he learnt some skills such as bottling and the weaving of chair seats.Today, Kondiba lives in Jalna, a market town close to his native village. He has married a local girl and runs a small business. Kondiba Gaikwad’s bravery and determination to find the boy in the well had completely changed his own life.The beggar who hated begging need never beg again.***

## DO YOU KNOW
#### ***How to help oneself and others in emergencies/disastrous situations***
***In life, we come across accidents like fires, plane crashes, road accidents, and cases of drowning as well as calamities such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones or terror attacks. In all these emergencies, we can improve the survival rates with our preparedness and empathy towards others.***

#### ***We only need to remember the following rules:***

- Be brave and stay calm. Certain coping devices like controlled, rhythmic breathing can keep anxiety under control.
- Make a thorough assessment of the situation.
- Think of possibilities
- Be sure you have enough information required to help yourself or rescue a person or presons.
- Even though you need to take quick action, take a moment to think clearly as to what you should do. Do not do anything that will endanger you or others. Do not hesitate to ask others to assist you or to raise the alert.

#### ***The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 holds the State responsible for the prevention of disabilities, protection of rights, provision of medical care, education, training, employment and rehabilitation of persons with disabilities.***
#### ***The Human Rights approach recognises that the talents of children with disabilities need to be optimally developed for the benefit of the whole of society. This approach recognises and emphasises that people with disabilities can accomplish a particular task or perform a particular function, but only in a different manner or taking more time or effort than people without a disability. Hence, the term ‘differently-abled’ is used to refer to disabled or handicapped people.***
#### ***The following examples show how infrastructure and the inability of able-bodied people to understand the needs of the differently-abled people create problems for them:***

- It is the stairs leading into a building that disable the wheelchair user rather than the wheelchair.

- It is defects in the design of everyday equipment that cause difficulties, not the abilities of people using it.

- It is society’s lack of skill in using and accepting alternative ways to communicate that excludes people with communication disabilities.

***Past Tense***
*In ‘Snakebite’, we learnt that:we use the past tense when we talk about an event that took place at a specific point of time in the past.
we use the second form of the verb for the past tense.*

***Phrasal Verbs***
*A phrasal verb is a simple verb combined with an adverb or a preposition or sometimes both to make a new verb with a meaning that is different from that of the simple verb. For example, read the sentence ‘Kondiba's life had to go on.’ In this sentence ‘go on’ means ‘continue.*

* Some tall trees in the rain forests can be more than **100 feet tall** but most of the tall trees around us in India grow to a height of about **40 feet**.

* The following are accepted as the top three tallest species of trees:
    1.  **Coast Redwood (379.1 feet)** California, USA
    2.  **Australian Mountain Ash (326.8 feet)** Tasmania, Australia
    3.  **Coast Douglas Fir (326.1 feet)** Oregon, USA

* This tree was planted from a cutting of the original Bodhi Tree in Gaya. The cutting was carried by Emperor Ashoka's daughter **Sanghamitra to Sri Lanka**.

* It takes **100 years to 3000 years** for a bodhi tree to grow fully.

Trees are an integral part of our world. There are a number of poems about trees. One such poem is given below:

A tree stood so strong on top of a hill
It was majestic and handsome, gracious if you will
It was a shelter to some, to others a toy
Just to be with people brought the tree great joy

## LET US LEARN GRAMMAR

## APPRECIATION

***Personification***

*When we speak of a thing as if it were a living being it is called 'personification' of that object. For example, when we say 'walls have ears' we speak of walls as if they were living beings with ears. When we say 'fortune smiles on those who work hard' we give a human form and a smile to good luck.*

*We apply human qualities and feelings to something that is not human in order to create a clear and vivid picture of that object or idea. Personification expresses the qualities of the personified object as human qualities and relates it to the world of humans. This adds intensity and clarity to an expression.*

*Poets often make use of this literary form.*

*You will notice that the second and the fourth lines of each stanza in the poem end in words that end with a similar sound. The similar sounds lend a flow and a rhythm to the lines and make them catchy and easy to remember.*

*The similar sound at the end of lines is called 'rhyme'. The pattern of rhyme varies from poem to poem. Poets create rhyme schemes of their own choice for the desired rhythm.*

## 🦁 Story Summary

The tiger, trained to perform in a circus, believed humans to be brave and unafraid. One day, he escapes and walks into the town through an open path. He is astonished to see people scream, run helter-skelter, hide behind trees and drains—even lock themselves in their homes at the sight of him. He hadn’t meant to harm anyone—he was full and content.

At one restaurant, he sits in the doorway, blocking the threshold with his tail, frightening the coffee drinkers. Later, he follows excited schoolchildren into a school and enters the headmaster’s room. The headmaster climbs onto a table and escapes into the attic. The tired tiger flops on the cool stone floor under the desk and promptly falls asleep—only to find himself locked in when he wakes.

The tiger hears his Master scolding the teachers for calling him a “brute” and “beast,” saying those are derogatory terms coined by humans in arrogance—and reminding them not to use such words. When someone asks the Master, “Who are you?”, he replies that it's a profound question—he has been trying all his life to find an answer and wonders if they ever know themselves.

- **Examples from the story:**
  - *They had sat in their seats peacefully while I cowered…*
  - *I had thought they were strong and fearless.*

These phrases show actions that were completed before another past action. The use of **"had + past participle"** is a key feature of the past perfect tense.

### B. Imperative Sentences in Indirect Speech

- An **imperative sentence** is a sentence that expresses a **command**, **request**, **instruction**, **advice**, or **suggestion**.

- When we change an imperative sentence into **indirect speech** (also called *Reported Speech*), we report what someone **instructed**, **ordered**, **advised**, or **suggested**.

#### 👉 Rules for Conversion:

1. The **reporting verb** (e.g., *said*, *told*, *said to*) is changed to a verb that reflects the tone:
   - **Commands** → *ordered*, *instructed*, *told*
   - **Requests** → *asked*, *begged*, *requested*, *pleaded*
   - **Advice** → *advised*, *recommended*, *urged*
   - **Suggestions** → *suggested*, *recommended*, *proposed*

2. The imperative verb (base form) is usually changed to **“to + verb”**  
   Example:  
   - Direct: *The teacher said, “Sit down.”*  
   - Indirect: *The teacher **ordered** me **to sit down.***

3. For **negative commands**, use **"not to + verb"**  
   Example:  
   - Direct: *He said, “Don’t shout.”*  
   - Indirect: *He **told** me **not to shout.***

## 🎨 Literary Device: Simile

A simile is a figure of speech where two different things are compared using "like" or "as".

**Common similes:**
- As clear as a stream  
- As heavy as lead  
- As dark as night  
- As bright as a star  
- As cold as ice

## 🦁 Story Summary

Part 1:  
The tiger wakes after a deep sleep and stretches, growling softly—frightening the headmaster who hides in the attic. Outside, the Master pleads with teachers to let him in unarmed to lead the tiger out; they refuse. They call the Magistrate, who forbids the Master’s entry unless he signs an affidavit stating no one will be held responsible for his safety. The Master agrees—but writes the affidavit in Sanskrit, leaving them baffled because they can’t read it.

Part 2:  
The Magistrate, believing Sanskrit is an official language, accepts the document. Furious at the ignorance he perceives, the Master uses the moment to mock their limited perspective. Before retrieving his tiger, he advises the Headmaster not to look at humans if he desires peace of mind.

## 🧾 DO YOU KNOW  
### **HOW ARE TIGERS COUNTED?**

Just as the Government conducts a population census, it also carries out an animal census every four years. In India, this is called the **All India Wild Animal Census**. A separate **Tiger Census** is conducted every two years.

#### 🐾 Methods and Details:

- The area is divided into smaller **zones**, and then **compartments**. The census normally lasts **8–10 days**.

- Earlier, census teams would monitor water bodies, believing that tigers came to drink once every 24 hours. But this assumption was incorrect and made the method unreliable.

- Today, the most preferred method is by recording **pug marks** (tiger footprints). These marks are commonly found near rivers, ponds, or forest paths. Once a clear pug mark is found, an **impression** (print) of it is taken and analyzed for size, shape, and other features. This helps to **identify individual tigers**.

- Sometimes, modern techniques like **camera trapping**, **DNA analysis**, and **satellite tracking** are also used to improve accuracy and study tiger behavior.

## 👞 Story Summary

The narrator, a young unemployed graduate, is sitting outside the Indian Coffee House in Connaught Circus, Delhi. He wants to enjoy a simple plate of chips and a cup of coffee, but his pockets are almost empty. He hesitates even to enter the restaurant because he can’t afford the meal. As he sits on the pavement, lost in thought, a shoeshine boy named **Shovan Lal** approaches him.

Shovan Lal, around thirteen, is confident and cheerful. He offers to polish the narrator’s shoes. The narrator politely declines, saying, “I can’t afford even chips and coffee.” This surprises the boy. He looks carefully at the narrator and says, “Then what are you doing here?” His innocent honesty amuses the narrator.

Shovan tells the narrator that a shoeshine boy can earn up to fifty rupees a day, sometimes more than a government clerk. He points to the other side of the road where licensed shoeshine boys work in teams. He, however, works alone and without a license—technically making his job illegal.

What’s remarkable is Shovan’s **dignity** and **self-respect**. He doesn’t beg. He’s proud of earning his living, even if it’s through polishing shoes on the street. When the narrator asks why he doesn’t just work with the licensed group, Shovan explains that working alone gives him freedom and avoids unfair rules.

Eventually, Shovan insists on polishing the narrator’s shoes for free, just to show his skill. The narrator, moved by the boy’s pride and warmth, agrees. When Shovan finishes the job, the narrator tries to tip him, but the boy refuses. “Pay when you can,” he says with a smile.

The encounter leaves the narrator reflecting on life. Shovan Lal, despite being poor and unlicensed, displays a level of grace, confidence, and honesty rarely seen—even among the educated.

## ✉️ Story Summary

In 1930, **Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru**, imprisoned in Naini Jail by the British, writes a heartfelt letter to his daughter **Indira** on her 13th birthday. Since he cannot send her a birthday gift from prison, he offers her the “present of the mind and spirit,” which no prison walls can imprison. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Nehru expresses his dislike for lecturing or sermonizing. Instead, he encourages **discussion and questioning** as means to discover truth. He believes that children should learn right from wrong by talking things through, not by simply being told. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

He refers to ordinary people—throughout history—who, when inspired by a great cause, like the independence movement led by Gandhi, become heroes. Such heroes are not born from exceptional birthright, but arise when ordinary people choose honour over fear. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Nehru advises Indira to choose **openness, honesty, and light** in her life. He tells her:  
> *“Never do anything in secret or anything you would wish to hide… Fear is a bad thing and unworthy of you.”* :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

This letter is not only a birthday message, but a timeless guide to integrity, courage, and truth.

## 20. NEW GOOD THINGS FROM RUBBISH  
*Author: Unknown (NIOS Class X English)*

## 🌍 Text Overview

### 📘 Part 1: Recycling Basics  
Recycling and reusing paper, metal, glass, and some plastics reduces pollution. Burning waste creates harmful gasses, while deforestation for paper wastes resources. Reusing materials lowers demand and helps preserve nature.  

### 📦 Part 2: Recycling Plastic & Metal  
Plastic is hard to recycle and doesn’t return to original quality—but it can be reused (e.g., filling cushions, fencing). Metal recycling saves resources and energy (e.g., recycling aluminium uses 25% less energy than producing new from bauxite), making metal a valuable reusable material.  

### 🧱 Part 3: Recycling Glass & Paper  
Glass bottles can be reused multiple times (e.g., milk bottles used ~30 times in Europe). Broken glass (cullet) must be sorted by color before melting. Paper makes up nearly half of global waste—recycling it saves trees and energy.

## 🌾 Story Summary

Hardworking cattle farmers in Gujarat remained poor due to exploitation by middlemen. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel encouraged them to form a co‑operative. Tribhuvandas Patel organized farmers into groups that sold milk collectively, eliminating middlemen.  

Dr. Verghese Kurien, an engineer from the Dairy Research Institute, was recruited to help build a modern dairy facility. His efforts led to the establishment of Amul, marking the beginning of India's dairy revolution. The co‑operative model gave farmers greater control over production and profits, improving their livelihoods.

## 🦜 Story Summary

Aunt Ruby brings home a dull-green parrot and complains it "can’t talk, can’t sing, can’t dance," which hurts the bird. Her nephew (the narrator) slips it green chilies, ripe tomatoes, and mango slices. During siesta one afternoon, he opens the cage door; the parrot flies out, rejoicing in freedom. Later, Aunt Ruby is stunned when it returns and mimics her own critical words — proof it *can* talk. A warm, ironic twist ends the story.

## 🧠 LET US LEARN GRAMMAR

### A. Modals

**Modals are special verbs that are used with the main verb to make the sentence more meaningful.**

Modals are used to:  
- Indicate the possibility or necessity of an event  
- Make requests, offers, or suggestions  
- Make what you are saying more polite or seek permission  
- Express ability or certainty  
- Express moral obligation or duty  
- Express willingness, promise, or intention  

#### ✅ Common Modal Verbs

| Can | Could | May | Might | Must |  
|-----|-------|-----|-------|------|  
| Ought to | Shall | Should | Will | Would |

📝 *Need* and *dare* can sometimes be used as modal verbs.

**Examples:**
1. **May** I borrow your notebook? *(permission)*  
2. I **could** ride a horse at five. *(ability)*  
3. **Could** you help me? *(request)*  
4. It **may** rain today. *(possibility)*  
5. You **must** eat healthy. *(necessity)*  
6. We **ought to** respect parents. *(moral duty)*  
7. **Shall** I bring water? *(offer)*  
8. I **will** write to you. *(promise)*  
9. How **dare** you slap me? *(interrogative)*  
10. We **should** take care of pets. *(duty)*  
11. I **can** speak German. *(ability)*

**Remember:**
- Modals do **not take ‘-s’** in third person  
- No **-ing** or **-ed** form  
- Not used in past/future tense  
- Use **not** after modals to make them negative  
- Must be followed by a main verb
