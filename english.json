We often imitate people we admire. Copying hairstyles, way of dressing, manner of speaking or habits of film stars, public figures, and/or friends and relatives is quite common. But have you ever thought whether the person you are imitating is a suitable role model? When Gandhiji was about twelve, he and his relative imitated an uncle who smoked. They thought it would be fun to blow out clouds of smoke. They picked up cigarette stubs and stole money from the servants so that they could buy cigarettes. Like all teenagers, they wanted independence. They decided that life was not worth living because they had to seek permission from their elders for everything they did. The got some seeds that they believed were poisonous. However, they couldn't get the courage to eat all of them because they did not want to die. At that age, all kinds of thoughts and ideas cross one's mind and often, some problems seem huge. But don't you think there are better ways of solving a problem than suicide?"

Later, he felt guilty of his act of stealing. He repented for his action as he know that he had done something wrong. He decided that he would never steal again. He felt very disturbed and wanted to confess to his father but couldn't get himself to face him. He also knew that his father would be very pained to know what he had done. Gandhiji did not want to hurt his father but he could not bear to live with the guilt. So he decided to confess to his brother. It requires courage to admit one's mistake and to speak the truth. Don't you think so? Gandhiji got the courage to confess because he knew he was doing the right thing. Had you been in Gandhiji's situation, what would you have done?"

He was better than me in everything; at lessons, in arguments and in manners, and all this took me farther from him and caused me moral anguish which I could not understand. When Valodya was given a tucked linen shirt for the first time I was unhappy for not having a shirt like that.

Can you hear the cry of helplessness of the child, who speaks for all the children of the world, to grown-ups who have created destructive weapons? The child says that the children will have no future if the adults continue to produce deadly weapons. Arms and ammunition put humanity in serious danger. The poem talks of the fears and worries to which the adults pay no attention or which they simply dismiss with their lies. Can you guess the lies? The lies are usually - \"No, we will not use arms against anyone. The world is safe. There is no need to worry.” The child desperately repeats that the grown-ups must stop destroying the world but he finds that they don't listen to him. The problem is that only the adults can build a better world, but it is the adults who are destroying it. It does not make much difference when the children speak of peace, friendship and fellowship. It is the adults who should understand the importance of peace and friendship in the world."

If we make new materials every time we need new things, it will result in a gradual decline of our natural resources. Waste materials will keep collecting and our beautiful earth will start to look like a garbage bin. Hence it is important to control our wasteful habits. We must understand that old metal or plastic utensils, old books, newspapers, and other waste can either be reused or recycled.

He believes that making statues of gods and goddesses out of stone is like worshipping God because this is the work God wants him to do. He makes each statue lovingly and patiently.

He wants to make things that will be easier and English Secondary Course 207 The Last Stone Mason Notes faster to carve, so that he will be able to make them in large numbers for rich tourists to buy.

The younger artisans want to make large quantities of products for tourists because this will help them earn more money. This is possible only if the crafts are machine made. However machine made products lack the uniqueness of handmade crafts; they all look the same. Older artisans are unable to convince their children that they should continue to practise the family art with commitment because it is a service to society. As family relationships become weak, and as the young people leave their family handicrafts businesses. We all need to think about the problems of our artisans. We need to help them by formal training buying their products and spreading awareness of their problems. We also need to know that the value and beauty of a handmade item lies in its uniqueness and we should be willing to pay a higher price for it."

Asha Devi worked hard for almost a year to make the villagers agree to reduce all wasteful spending. Finally the villagers realised that her suggestions would be for their own good. They convinced the Panchayat to support their decision that in the future all weddings would be simple and only small gifts would be allowed. Asha Devi also succeeded in banning fireworks, loud music and firearms during social ceremonies. She felt that loud music and fireworks caused pollution and carrying firearms was dangerous for society. Today the people of this little village are happy because they can save money and use it for other necessities."

The poet tells his son about the behaviour of people in the past and in the present, in the olden days and in the modern world. He remembers a time when people had true feelings for one another. They would laugh from the heart and meet one another with genuine feeling. But today in the modern, busy world people often greet each other without any warmth in their handshake. They greet each other with a smile or a laugh that does not reach their eyes or warm their hearts. When they say ‘come again' to a guest they don't really mean it, they only say it to be polite. According to the poet, people these days are often interested in meeting people only if they are rich, powerful, successful or famous, and do not value or respect those who have no wealth or position."

To be a part of the society we need to learn behaviour that is accepted in society. We begin to learn this as we grow up and behave according to the situation we are in. We learn this behaviour so well that our natural behaviour slowly disappears, and in each different situation we behave in the way that is considered appropriate for that situation. The poet says that he behaves very differently in the office, compared to the way he behaves at a party, or on the street. And none of these different faces that he puts on is his natural self or his real face.
