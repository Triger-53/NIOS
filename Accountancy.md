## 5. Accounting Concepts (GAAP) and Conventions

| Concept / Convention  | Explanation                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business Entity**   | Business and owner are separate; personal transactions excluded from business accounts.                     |
| **Money Measurement** | Only transactions measurable in monetary terms are recorded.                                                |
| **Going Concern**     | Business assumed to continue operations for foreseeable future; justifies asset valuation and depreciation. |
| **Dual Aspect**       | Every transaction has two effects; forms the **Accounting Equation: Assets = Liabilities + Capital**.       |
| **Consistency**       | Same accounting methods used period-to-period for comparability; changes disclosed.                         |
| **Materiality**       | Only items significant enough to influence decisions should be reported separately.                         |
| **Conservatism**      | ‚ÄúAnticipate no profit, but provide for all possible losses.‚Äù Assets and incomes recorded conservatively.    |

# üìò Module II: The Double Entry System and Recording

## 1. The Double Entry System and Rules

The **Double Entry System** records both receiving and giving aspects of transactions so total debits equal total credits.

| Account Type          | Rule of Debit (Dr.)               | Rule of Credit (Cr.)               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Assets**            | Increase in Asset  ‚Üí Debit (+)    | Decrease in Asset ‚Üí Credit (‚Äì)     |
| **Expenses / Losses** | Increase in Expense ‚Üí Debit (+)   | Decrease in Expense ‚Üí Credit (‚Äì)   |
| **Liabilities**       | Decrease in Liability ‚Üí Debit (‚Äì) | Increase in Liability ‚Üí Credit (+) |
| **Capital**           | Decrease in Capital ‚Üí Debit (‚Äì)   | Increase in Capital ‚Üí Credit (+)   |
| **Revenue / Gains**   | Decrease in Revenue ‚Üí Debit (‚Äì)   | Increase in Revenue ‚Üí Credit (+)   |

> Quick reminder: Because of these rules, **every journal entry** will show at least one debit and one credit; the totals must match.

## 2. Source Documents and Vouchers

| Item                    | Purpose / Use                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source Documents**    | Documentary evidence of transactions (invoice, cash memo, receipt, challan). |
| **Accounting Vouchers** | Prepared from source docs to record entries; authorized/countersigned.       |
| **Debit Vouchers**      | For cash payments (e.g., payment to supplier).                               |
| **Credit Vouchers**     | For cash receipts (e.g., cash sales).                                        |
| **Transfer Vouchers**   | For non-cash transactions (credit sales, depreciation, accruals, returns).   |

## 3. The Journal (Book of Original Entry)

* **Journalising**: Recording transactions chronologically with debit(s), credit(s), and narration.
* **Ledger Folio (L.F.)**: Column used to indicate ledger page/account reference.
* **Compound Entries**: Single journal entries affecting more than two accounts (e.g., paying multiple expenses).

## 4. Subsidiary Books (Special Purpose Books)

When transaction volume is large, use specialized books for efficiency.

| Subsidiary Book    | Purpose                                                                         | Key Rules / Features                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cash Book**      | Records cash receipts & payments. Serves as Journal & Cash/Bank ledger.         | Contra entries (C) for cash‚Üîbank transfers; cash side totals vs bank side.                    |
| **Purchases Book** | Records only credit purchases of goods for resale.                              | Cash purchases or credit purchases of assets excluded.                                        |
| **Sales Book**     | Records only credit sales of goods.                                             | Cash sales and credit sales of assets excluded.                                               |
| **Returns Books**  | Records Sales Returns (Returns Inward) and Purchases Returns (Returns Outward). | Use Credit Notes (sales returns) and Debit Notes (purchase returns).                          |
| **Journal Proper** | Entries not fitting other books.                                                | Opening entries, closing entries, adjustments, rectifications, non-trade credit transactions. |

# üìò Module III: Ledger and Verification

## 1. The Ledger and Posting

* **Ledger**: Principal book containing all accounts (one account per item like Cash A/c, Sales A/c).
* **Posting**: Transfer of journal/subsidiary book entries to ledger accounts.

  * Debit parts are posted on the debit side (prefixed ‚ÄúTo‚Ä¶‚Äù in narration).
  * Credit parts posted on the credit side (prefixed ‚ÄúBy‚Ä¶‚Äù).
* **Balancing**: Total debit and credit sides; difference is closing balance and carried forward as b/d/c/d as appropriate.
* **Nominal Accounts** (Revenue/Expenses) are usually closed to Trading or Profit & Loss account.

## 2. The Trial Balance (TB)

* **Trial Balance**: Statement of all ledger balances on a specific date ‚Äî debit balances in one column, credit balances in the other.
* **Objective**: Check arithmetic accuracy and equality of debit and credit totals.
* **Not conclusive proof** ‚Äî equal totals can still hide errors.

### Errors Disclosed by Trial Balance

| Error Type          | Example                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Omission of posting | Entry posted to only one account.        |
| Double posting      | Same amount posted twice in one account. |
| Wrong side posting  | Posted credit as debit or vice versa.    |
| Wrong amount        | Incorrect figure recorded.               |
| Wrong totaling      | Mistake in totaling subsidiary books.    |
| Omitted account     | Account not included in TB.              |

### Errors Not Disclosed by Trial Balance

| Error Type          | Example                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Complete Omission   | Transaction entirely omitted from books.          |
| Error of Principle  | Treating capital purchase as revenue expense.     |
| Compensating Errors | Two errors offset each other leaving TB balanced. |

* **Suspense Account**: Temporary account used when TB does not tally to allow preparation of final accounts while errors are traced.

## 3. Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS)

* **Purpose**: Explain differences between Cash Book (bank column) and Pass Book (bank statement) balances on a date.

| Cause                                      | Effect / Example                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheques issued but not presented           | Cash Book balance lower than Pass Book.                 |
| Cheques deposited but not credited by bank | Cash Book balance higher than Pass Book.                |
| Bank-only entries (charges, interest)      | Reduce Pass Book balance (e.g., bank charges).          |
| Direct deposits/collections by bank        | Increase Pass Book balance (e.g., dividends collected). |
| Dishonour of cheques                       | Reduces Cash Book balance; needs adjustment.            |

# üìò Module IV: Asset Management and Future Contingencies

## 1. Depreciation

**Depreciation**: Allocation of the cost of a fixed asset over its useful life due to wear & tear, obsolescence, or passage of time.

**Objectives of Depreciation**

1. Show true financial position (avoid overstatement of assets).
2. Retain funds for replacement.
3. Allocate cost to periods that benefit from the asset.

**Causes**: Wear & tear, obsolescence, accidental damage, inadequacy.

**Factors Affecting Calculation**: Cost of asset, useful life, scrap (residual) value, method of depreciation.

### Methods of Charging Depreciation

| Feature               | Straight Line Method (SLM)                   | Diminishing Balance Method (DBM)                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Calculation Basis     | On original cost                             | On written down value (WDV)                          |
| Annual Amount         | Fixed each year                              | Decreases each year                                  |
| Asset Value Over Time | Can reach scrap/zero                         | Never reaches zero                                   |
| P&L Burden Pattern    | Higher in later years (repairs may increase) | More even overall (dep. decreases, repairs increase) |

## 2. Provisions and Reserves

| Feature         | Provision                                                                | Reserve                                                    |
