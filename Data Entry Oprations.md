## I. Basics of a Computer System

A computer is a device that **transforms data into meaningful information**. Data can be anything like marks obtained by you in various subjects, or details like name, age, sex, weight, or height.

### A. Functions and Characteristics
A computer performs five main functions:
1.  **Accept data** (input).
2.  **Store data**.
3.  **Process data** as required.
4.  **Retrieve** the stored data when needed.
5.  **Print the result** in the desired format (output).

The major characteristics of a computer system are **high speed, accuracy, diligence, versatility, and storage**.

### B. Computer Organization (The Block Diagram)
The computer system consists of different parts organized to perform tasks systematically.

The five major operations performed are:
1.  **Input:** The process of entering data and programs into the system.
2.  **Storage (Memory Unit):** Used to store data and instructions.
3.  **Processing:** Handled by two main components:
    *   **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs major operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logic, and comparison.
    *   **Control Unit (CU):** Supervises the input, output, processing, and storage operations. It manages the step-by-step processing of all operations inside the computer.
4.  **Output:** The process of producing results from the data for getting useful information.
5.  **Control:** Manages all operations inside a computer.

The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is jointly formed by the ALU and the CU. The CPU is considered the **brain** of any computer system.

### C. Hardware and Software
Computer components are divided into two main categories:
1.  **Hardware:** The physical machine itself and its connected devices, such as the monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
2.  **Software:** A set of programs (instructions) that instructs the hardware on what to do, how to do it, and when to do it.

**Peripheral Devices** are devices connected externally to the computer for specific functions, classified as Input Devices, Output Devices, and Other Peripherals.

**Input Devices** accept data and instructions from the user. Examples include:
*   **Keyboard:** The most common input device (often QWERTY board, usually 104 keys).
*   **Mouse:** An electro-mechanical, hand-held device used as a pointer for "Point and Click" actions (can use a ball or optical/laser detection).
*   **Light Pen:** Uses a light-sensitive detector to select objects on the display screen.
*   **Optical Scanner:** Used for automatic data collection (e.g., bar-code readers or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) devices used by banks).
*   **Touch Screen:** Accepts input directly through the computer screen.
*   **Track Ball:** A stationary pointing device popular for portable computers, where you rotate the ball with your thumb or hand.
*   **Microphone:** Used to take **voice as input**.

**Output Devices** return processed data (information) back to the user. Examples include:
*   **Monitor (Visual Display Unit):** Two basic types are the **CRT** (Cathode Ray Tube) monitor (typical desktop type) and the modern **LCD** (Liquid Crystal Displays, or flat panel monitor). Most monitors have a resolution of at least **800 x 600 pixels**. High-end monitors can have resolutions of **1024 x 768 pixels** or even **1280 x 1024 pixels**.
*   **Printers:** Produce a hard copy (printout). Common types are **Laser Printer** (high quality, fast, quiet), **Ink Jet Printer** (sprays ink, good quality, quiet but not fast), **Dot Matrix Printer** (produces text by combinations of dots, inexpensive but loud and slower), and **Line Printer** (high-speed printers used with large systems, speeds ranging from 100 to about 3800 lines per minute).
*   **Plotter:** A special output device designed to produce large drawings or images, such as construction plans or blueprints. Plotters typically come in **Flat Bed** (small size) and **Drum** (big size, unlimited paper length) designs.
*   **Speakers:** Allow you to listen to voice or music.

### D. Software and Languages
Software is classified into two main types:
1.  **System Software:** Responsible for running the computer, controlling operations, and managing resources.
    *   **Operating System (OS):** Provides an interface for user communication, manages hardware, and supports application programs (e.g., UNIX, Windows, Linux).
    *   **Utilities:** Programs that bridge the gap between the OS functionality and user needs (e.g., compress/uncompress files software, anti-virus software).
2.  **Application Software:** Written to perform specific tasks.
    *   **Generalized Packages:** Cater to general needs like preparing documents (Word Processing), data analysis (Spreadsheets), or drawing pictures (Graphics Tools).
    *   **Customized Packages:** Developed to meet specific requirements of an organization/institution (e.g., Payroll packages, Student information details, inventory control).

**Computer Languages** are the means of communication with the machine, bound by rules known as SYNTAX.
*   **Low Level Language:** Closeness to how the machine understands.
    *   *Machine Language:* Uses **0s and 1s** (binary numbers) and is understood directly by the computer. It is machine dependent.
    *   *Assembly Language:* Uses symbolic codes (mnemonics) instead of 0s and 1s. It is machine dependent.
*   **High Level Language:** Uses normal English-like, easy-to-understand statements and is computer independent. Examples include **BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, C, and C++**.

Translation software is required to convert high-level or assembly language programs into machine language:
*   **Compiler:** Reads a program written in a high-level language (Source Program) and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language (Object Program).
*   **Assembler:** Reads a program written in assembly language (Source Program) and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language (Object Program).

## II. Operating System and File Management (Windows XP)

The modern operating system (OS) uses a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, where commands are visible as icons. Windows is the most popular operating system today.

### A. Windows XP Environment
When Windows XP starts, a log-in screen may appear requiring a password. Key desktop elements include:
*   **Start Menu:** Displays options like **All Programs** (installed applications), **My Documents/Pictures/Music**, **Control Panel** (to configure the system), **Help and Support**, **Search**, and **Turn Off Computer**. It also includes **Run** (to start an application program or execute a DOS command) and **Log Off** (to log off the currently logged-in user).
*   **Task Bar:** Appears at the bottom of the screen and remains visible. Icons representing open programs appear here.

### B. File Management
File management is done through **Windows Explorer** or **My Computer**.
*   **My Computer:** Displays the contents of drives (floppy, hard disk, CD-ROM, network drives).
*   **Windows Explorer:** Displays a hierarchical list of files, folders, and storage drives.

**Basic File Operations:**
*   **Copying/Moving:** Done via drag and drop, or by selecting the file/folder and using Copy/Cut and Paste or using these shortcuts [CTRL+C for copy, CTRL+X for cut and CTRL+V for paste]. To select non-consecutive files, hold down the **CTRL** key while clicking.

## IV. Mail Merge

Mail Merge is a word processing feature used to produce personalized mailings to multiple people using a single template.

It requires three types of documents:
1.  **Main Document:** The personalized document (e.g., a standard letter, label, or envelope) containing the text and graphics that stays the same for every version.
2.  **Data Source:** A file containing the variable information, such as names and addresses (recipients).
3.  **Merge Document:** The final document produced when the Main Document and Data Source are combined, typically containing personalized letters or labels.

The **Mail Merge Wizard** guides you through the process in 6 steps. Data Sources can be created by typing a new list in the Wizard, or by using data structured in a **Word Table**, or an **Excel Worksheet**. The process involves selecting the document type (Letters, Envelopes, Labels), selecting the recipients (Data Source), and inserting **Merge Fields** (placeholders like «Name» or «City») into the Main Document. Finally, the merge is completed to view or print the personalized results.

## V. Basics of Spreadsheet (MS Excel 2007)

A spreadsheet is useful for entering, editing, analyzing, and performing arithmetic/mathematical operations on data arranged in rows and columns.

### A. Worksheet Structure and Navigation
*   An Excel file is a **workbook** that holds multiple **worksheets**.
*   A worksheet is a grid defined by **columns** (letters) and **rows** (numbers).
*   The intersection is a **cell**, which has a unique **cell address** (e.g., A1, C5).
*   The Excel 2007 grid provides up to **1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns**.
*   You can enter data (numbers, text, date/time) into cells. If a number should be treated as text, start the entry with an apostrophe (‘).
*   To rename a worksheet in Excel Right-click on the worksheet tab and select 'Rename' from the pop-up menu. 
*   **AutoFill** allows you to quickly fill cells with repetitive or sequential data, such as chronological dates or numbers.

## VI. Formulas, Functions, and Charts

Formulas and functions are vital for manipulating data and calculating results.

### A. Formulas and Functions
*   **Formulas:** Must always begin with an **equal sign (=)**. They use mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) and cell references (e.g., `= B1 * C1`).
*   **Functions:** Built-in formulas that take cell references or values as arguments (inputs) within parentheses.
    *   **AutoSum:** A feature that quickly adds contents of adjacent cells.
    *   **SUM()**: Adds all numbers in a range of cells.
    *   **AVERAGE()**: Returns the arithmetic mean of arguments.
    *   **MIN() / MAX()**: Returns the smallest/largest number in a set of values.
    *   **SUMIF()**: Adds cells that meet a given criteria.

### B. Charts and Graphics
**Charts** present worksheet data in a visual format.

**Types of Charts**:
*   **Column Charts:** Used to compare values across categories.
*   **Line Charts:** Used to display continuous data over time, suitable for viewing trends.
*   **Pie Charts:** Show the relative proportions or contributions to a whole (uses only one data series).
*   **Bar Charts:** Show comparisons between individual items (often horizontal orientation).
*   **XY (Scatter) Charts:** Show the relationship among two variables, where both axes display values.
*   **Area Charts:** Highlight the degree of a change over time.
*   **Stock Charts:** Used to demonstrate fluctuations related to stock market prices or scientific data (e.g., temperature).
*   **Surface Charts:** Used when both categories and data series are numeric values, useful for finding optimum combinations.
*   **Doughnut Charts:** Illustrate the relationship of parts to a whole but can handle more than one data series.
*   **Bubble Charts:** Plot data where x, y, and bubble size values are listed in adjacent columns.
*   **Radar Charts:** Compare the aggregate values of a number of data series.

### **Chart Components**

Chart components are the key elements that make up a chart and help convey data clearly and accurately. These include:

* **Chart Title:** Describes the overall purpose or subject of the chart. It helps viewers quickly understand what the data represents.
* **X-Axis (Horizontal Axis) and Y-Axis (Vertical Axis) Titles:** Label each axis to indicate what kind of data is being measured or compared (e.g., “Months” on the X-Axis and “Sales Revenue ($)” on the Y-Axis).
* **X-Axis Categories:** Represent the distinct groups or intervals of data plotted along the horizontal axis (e.g., months, products, or years).
* **Y-Axis Values:** Show the numerical scale or measurement for the data on the vertical axis. These values indicate the magnitude or frequency of the data points.
* **Data Series:** A collection of related data points that are plotted on the chart. Each data series typically represents one category or group of data.
* **Data Labels:** Display the actual data values directly on the chart, making it easier to interpret specific figures without referring to the axis scale.
* **Legend:** Identifies the colors, symbols, or patterns used for different data series, allowing the viewer to distinguish between them easily.
* **Tick Marks:** Small lines along the axes used to indicate measurement intervals or scaling, helping to interpret the values between major points.
* **Grid Lines:** Horizontal or vertical lines across the chart that align with tick marks, improving readability by making it easier to compare values visually.
* **Plot Area:** The area of the chart where data is actually plotted, bounded by the axes.
* **Chart Area:** The overall space that includes the plot area, titles, legend, and other chart elements.
* **Grid Lines** (displays lines at the major intervals on axes). Charts are created by selecting the data range and choosing a type from the **Insert Tab**.

A finished chart can be copied into a **Microsoft Word document or PowerPoint slide**.

**Graphics Features:**
*   **AutoShapes:** Allows you to draw geometric shapes, arrows, and flowchart elements. Categories include Lines, Connectors, Basic Shapes, Block Arrows, Flow Chart, Stars and Banners, and Call Outs.
*   **SmartArt Graphics:** Provides visual representations of ideas and information (e.g., Process, Cycle, Hierarchy, Relationship).
*   **Clip Art:** Single media files (art, sound, animation) that can be inserted into the worksheet.
*   **Pictures:** You can insert pictures, photos, or graphics from an existing file.

## VII. Creating Presentations (MS PowerPoint 2007)

PowerPoint helps you create slides and present slide shows to communicate ideas effectively.

### A. Presentation Creation and Viewing
*   You can start a presentation using an **Installed Template**, a **Design Template (Installed Themes)**, or a **Blank Presentation**.
*   Once a presentation is started, you choose a **Slide Layout**. The nine available layouts are: **Title Slide, Title and Content, Section Header, Two Content, Comparison, Title Only, Blank, Content with caption, and Picture with caption**.
*   Inside the content text box, you can insert six types of elements: **Insert table, Insert chart, Insert SmartArt Graphic, Insert picture from file, Insert Clip Art, [or] Insert Media Clip**.

PowerPoint has multiple views:
1.  **Normal View:** Where most of the creation work is done, dividing the screen into the current slide, the outline pane (left), and the notes pane (bottom).
2.  **Slide Sorter View:** Displays a small image of each slide, making it easy to order slides and add special effects/transitions.
3.  **Slide Show View:** Used for previewing or delivering the presentation, where all effects (sounds, animations, hyperlinks) are active.

### B. Design Tips
To prepare the best slides, follow these guidelines:
*   Use **contrasting colors** for text and background.
*   Use a font size of **24-point or larger**.
*   Use **short phrases and sentences** to convey your message.
*   Use **simple slide transitions**.
*   **Avoid cluttering** the slides with too much text or graphics.
*   Keep text simple by avoiding many different text effects (bold, italics, large font size) on the same slide.

### C. Working with Content
*   **Text Insertion:** Text is added using the **Outlining** feature (where Heading 1 becomes the title, Heading 2 the first line of the text box, etc.) or inserting **Text Boxes**.
*   **Formatting Text:** You can format fonts (size, style, color), and adjust **Line Spacing**. You can also quickly change the **Case** of text (e.g., Sentence case, Lowercase, Uppercase, Title case, Toggle case).
*   **Bulleted/Numbered Lists:** Text boxes often include built-in bulleted lists. You can also create new lists and change the bullet style, size, and color.
*   **Notes:** Added from **Normal View** in the notes pane. Notes are not visible during the presentation but can be printed out.
*   **Spell Check:** Accessed via the **F7** key or selecting **Review → Spelling**.
*   **Saving and Printing:** You can save the presentation as a file or as a **Web Page**. When printing, you can select whether to print **Slides** (full page), **Handouts** (multiple slides per page), **Notes Page**, or the **Outline view**.
