## Lesson 1: Snake Bite

One day I saw a small snake in the compound. It was crawling along slowly but when it saw me, it moved away quickly and hid itself in a coconut shell. I quietly went near and closed the mouth of the coconut shell with a stone. Then I took the shell and ran to Grandmother. “ Look, Grandma,” I cried, “ I have caught a snake.”

## Lesson 2: How the Squirrel Got His Stripes

Ram asked his army to build a bridge over the sea. Work began at once on a stone bridge. The monkeys pulled out rocks and heavy stones from the mountains, and carried them to the sea. They cut them into shape and began to build the bridge. All this was very difficult work and it took a long time.

Unfortunately, he had little luck selling his goods. He soon learnt that Mumbai is generous to beggars – especially blind beggars.
