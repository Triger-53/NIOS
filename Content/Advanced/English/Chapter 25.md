I would be delighted to provide you with a full, detailed explanation of the lesson titled **"ONCE UPON A TIME."** This poem by **Gabriel Okara** is a poignant reflection on the loss of genuine human connection and innocence in the modern world, as compared to the honesty and simplicity of childhood.

## Lesson 25: Once Upon a Time (Poem by Gabriel Okara)

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

The lesson begins by asking if you have heard older relatives talk about how the world was different in the past, when people had more time to talk and meet.

#### 1. The Theme: Loss of Innocence and Genuineness
The poem explores the shift from genuine human relationships to artificial, formal interactions in the modern world.
*   **Past (Childlike Innocence):** The old way of life was "innocent like a child" because people were **more honest and caring**. As children, we are "innocent, loving and honest about our feelings".
*   **Present (Adulthood/Modernity):** As time passes, social and cultural factors change our personality and behaviour, often taking away some of our **honesty and innocence**. People today often say nice things without meaning them, simply to avoid seeming rude or because it is the "correct thing to say".
*   **The Poet's Desire:** The poet wishes that the modern world would once again become **innocent and childlike**, and that he could once again be as natural, honest, and innocent as he was as a child.

#### 2. Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Recognise the **value of being genuine** in a relationship.
*   Compare changing behaviour patterns with time.
*   Explain implied comparison.
*   Identify the elements of **satire**.

### Part 2: Understanding the Text (Stanza by Stanza)

The poem is structured as a conversation where the father laments the current state of society to his son.

#### Part 1 (Stanzas 1, 2, and 3): The Failure of Modern Interaction

The poet contrasts the genuine past with the artificial present.

*   **Laughter (Stanza 1):** In the past, people used to **"laugh with their hearts and laugh with their eyes"**. Now, people "only laugh with their teeth". This means the laughter is **artificial** and without real feeling. Their eyes are **"ice-block-cold"** (emotionless) and "search behind my shadow," implying they are looking for something ulterior.
    *   *Human behaviour discussed:* False, formal, and artificial behaviour.
*   **Handshakes and Hidden Motives (Stanza 2):** There was a time when they used to **"shake hands with their hearts"** (conveying true feelings). Now, they shake hands **"without hearts"** (a handshake that does not show warmth but is a routine formality).
    *   *The Search:* Their **"left hands search my empty pockets"**. This signifies that modern people are only interested in meeting the poet if he is rich, powerful, successful, or famous. They are searching to find out if the poet is rich or poor.
*   **Hospitality (Stanza 3):** People say **"Feel at home"! ‘Come again’**. These pleasant words are used without meaning them, just to be polite. The poet notes that when he takes them seriously and comes "once, twice," there will be **"no thrice"**.
    *   *Lack of Welcome:* This phrase indicates that the guest is **no longer welcome if he/she visits someone very often**; the poet finds **"doors shut on me"**. The poet finds that he is not welcomed if he becomes a frequent visitor, even though he is told to 'feel at home'.
    *   *Cultural Note:* This contrasts with the Indian slogan **"Atithi Devo Bhava"** (Guest is God), which signifies that a guest, whose date of arrival is unknown, shall be treated like God.

#### Part 2 (Stanzas 4 and 5): Learning the Falsehood

The father confesses that he has learned to conform to this artificial society.

*   **Wearing Many Faces (Stanza 4):** The poet says he has learned to **"wear many faces like dresses"**—*homeface, officeface, streetface, hostface, cocktailface*. The different faces stand for the different ways a person conducts himself to suit the different situations he has to face.
    *   *The Smile:* These faces come with **"conforming smiles like a fixed portrait smile"**. This smile is a formality, lacking feelings or expression, like a smile in a picture.
*   **Insincere Communication (Stanza 5):** The father has also learned to say things that are the **exact opposite of his real feelings**.
    *   He says **‘Goodbye’** when he means **‘Good-riddance’** (a feeling of relief when an unwanted person leaves).
    *   He says **‘Glad to meet you’** without being glad.
    *   He says **‘It’s been nice talking to you’** after being bored.

#### Part 3 (Stanzas 6 and 7): The Desire to Return

The father expresses his deep dissatisfaction with his learned behaviour.

*   **The Wish to Unlearn (Stanza 6):** The father is dissatisfied with his "changed self" and desires to **"unlearn all these muting things"** (expressionless or not expressed in speech). He wants to return to his true self.
*   **The Snake’s Fangs:** Most of all, he wants to **"relearn how to laugh"** because his reflection in the mirror shows only his teeth, **"like a snake’s bare fangs"**.
    *   *Simile Explanation:* This simile suggests a laugh that is **without real feeling, falsely pleasant, and therefore dangerous and deceptive** like a snake. The poet uses it to show that he has forgotten how to laugh with pleasure, only showing his teeth and not his heart.
*   **The Plea to the Son (Stanza 7):** The father asks his son to **"show me, son, how to laugh and smile"**. He wants his son, who represents the **natural and honest** state of childhood, to help him find his old, simple, and sincere self again.

### Part 3: Literary Analysis and Social Commentary

#### 1. Satire
The poem is a **satire** on modern society, using humour, irony, and contradiction to criticize the falseness and insincerity.
*   **Examples of Satire:** The critique is expressed through contradictory and interesting expressions like people **"laugh only with their teeth," "shake hands without hearts,"** and their **"left hands search my empty pockets"**.
*   The idea of learning to **"wear many faces"** suggests that people in modern society are like actors changing masks on a stage, with no connection between their actions and their feelings.

#### 2. Significance of Time
The poem uses time references to draw a comparison.
*   **"Once upon a time"** makes the beginning sound like the poet is telling his son a story, referring to a long time ago.
*   The **father (as an adult)** stands for the modern period of falseness and artificiality.
*   The **son (as a child)** represents the old days when people were natural and honest.
*   By addressing his son, the poet is also addressing **all the adults of the modern world** who have lost their innocence, urging them to relearn sincerity.

#### 3. Communication Gap
Because people's words and actions are often the opposite of their true thoughts, it is difficult in modern society to know what to believe and what is reality. The consequence of this insincerity is that relationships are often measured solely in terms of **money or power**.
