I would be happy to provide you with a full, detailed explanation of the lesson titled **"A PRAYER FOR HEALING."** This poem serves as an urgent appeal for collective global action to protect and restore the Earth and improve the human community.

## Lesson 19: A Prayer for Healing (Poem)

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

The poem draws inspiration from ancient traditions across different cultures and religions where people prayed to objects of nature (sun, moon, stars, earth, wind, water bodies, plants, and animals) because humankind has always recognized their importance.

#### Key Objectives
After studying this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Recognize the **importance of planet earth** and related **environmental issues**.
*   Spread **awareness** about environmental issues (e.g., by writing letters, slogans, and through discussions).
*   Explain the **central idea** in the poem and justify the choice of words.
*   Identify the **refrain** in a poem or song.
*   Write a **letter to the editor** of a newspaper.
*   Enhance your **vocabulary** related to the environment.

#### The Theme: Collective Action and Restoration
The core message is that the Earth is **our only home**. The poem is an appeal to all people around the globe to make a **collective effort** to heal the Earth. It stresses that we must live respectfully on Earth.

### Part 2: Understanding the Poem (The Appeal)

The poem is structured around the repeating line (the refrain) and details specific areas where humanity must unite for restoration.

#### The Refrain
The line that is repeated several times and conveys the central idea of the poem is:
> **"We join with the earth and with each other"**.

This suggests that we must agree to work together to achieve the goals of healing and renewal.

#### Caring for Nature (Stanzas 1, 2, and 3)
The first three stanzas focus on the natural world, which provides us with air, water, and food.

*   **Land, Water, and Air:** We must work together to **bring new life to the land**, to **restore the waters** (bring them back to their original clean condition), and to **refresh the air** (make it fresh and pure again). This involves preventing pollution of these sources.
*   **Plants and Animals:** We must **renew the forests** (make them grow back), **care for the plants**, and **protect the creatures** (all types of animals, birds, and insects). When trees are cut or water is polluted, creatures lose their homes, and some species become extinct or endangered.
*   **Cosmic Elements:** We must **celebrate the seas** (show that we value them), **rejoice the sunlight** (express happiness at it), and **sing the song of the stars**. These elements are wonderful gifts of nature; they are beautiful and **sustain (preserve, protect, and support) life**.

#### Caring for Humanity (Stanzas 4 and 5)
The focus shifts to the human world, emphasizing community and future generations.

*   **Community:** We must **recreate the human community** (make it better). This means trying to create a community where people live in harmony with each other and their surroundings, and where all living things are respected and cared for.
*   **Moral Goals:** The poet urges us to **promote justice and peace**.
*   **Future Generations:** We must **remember our children**, which means we should work collectively to leave behind a better world for them.
*   **Unity in Diversity:** The final stanza highlights that we join together as **many and diverse expressions of one loving mystery**. This means that though no two human beings are exactly the same—differing in looks, temperament, culture, and beliefs—we share the same home and must work in harmony.

### Part 3: Environmental Awareness and Action

The lesson strongly advocates for active participation in environmental protection.

#### Why the Earth Needs Healing
There is an urgent need to heal the Earth because over time, harmful substances have caused air, water, and land **pollution**. Additionally, Earth’s resources are limited, leading to shortages, and resources that cannot be renewed must be **conserved**.

#### Practical Actions and Slogans
The lesson encourages several actions to protect the environment:
*   **Reduce Consumption:** Turn off unnecessary lights, buy energy-efficient appliances, use solar water heaters, and take print-outs only when necessary.
*   **Reuse and Recycle:** Use recycled products (especially paper), reuse envelopes, jars, and bags, and recycle to save resources. Recycling 1 ton of paper saves about 17 mature trees and 7,000 gallons of water.
*   **Avoid Pollution:** Avoid using anything made of plastic foam, and say **NO to crackers**, which are environmental abuse.
*   **Community Involvement:** Join a car pool, use public transport, volunteer, and participate in events like **Earth Hour**.

Slogans promoted in the lesson include: "Let’s go green to get our globe clean," and "Your Planet Needs You—Unite to Combat Climate Change".

#### International Initiatives
Various important days are celebrated globally to spread awareness:
*   **Earth Day:** April 22 (first held in 1970).
*   **World Water Day:** March 22 (declared in 1993).
*   **World Environment Day (WED):** June 5 (first observed in 1972).
*   **Earth Hour:** Last Saturday of March (initiated in 2007 by WWF).

### Part 4: Vocabulary and Writing Skills

The lesson teaches vocabulary relevant to environmental issues and practical communication skills.

#### Environmental Vocabulary
*   **Pollution:** The release of harmful/poisonous substances into the environment.
*   **Deforestation:** Clearing of forests by cutting trees.
*   **Conservation:** Protection of resources from harm, destruction, wastage, and overuse.
*   **Biodegradable material:** Material that can be decomposed by living organisms (e.g., vegetable peels, paper).
*   **Non-biodegradable material:** Material that does not decompose easily (e.g., glass bottles, which can take a million years; aluminium cans, 80-100 years; Styrofoam, 500 years).

#### Formal Letter Writing (Letter to the Editor)
Writing a letter to the editor is an effective way to share views on important issues with a large audience, which can influence readers and government policy.

**Tips for Writing:**
*   Keep the letter **brief, to-the-point, and interesting**.
*   Support the letter with **accurate facts and statistics**.
*   Open with a **strong statement** and close with **possible solutions/thoughts** for readers to remember.
*   If responding to an article, mention its heading, date, and correspondent's name.
