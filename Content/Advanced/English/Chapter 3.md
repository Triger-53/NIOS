This lesson, titled **"Kondiba—A Hero,"** is about bravery, determination, and changing perceptions of ability. It tells the remarkable story of a visually challenged man whose quick, selfless action transformed his life and taught his community the true meaning of heroism.

Here is a full, detailed breakdown of the lesson:

***

## Part 1: The Context of the Hero

The lesson aims to help you follow a story's sequence, understand emotions, value the contributions of differently-abled people, and critically analyze situations.

### 1. The Protagonist: Kondiba Gaikwad
*   **Background:** Kondiba was a 25-year-old man who was visually challenged (blind). He lost his eyesight due to smallpox when he was eight years old.
*   **Circumstance:** The great famine in Maharashtra in 1972–73 drove Kondiba from his home in Aurangabad to Mumbai in search of a livelihood (bread).
*   **Livelihood:** He initially tried selling brooms but failed to earn much. Although he **hated begging**, he learned that Mumbai was generous to beggars, especially blind ones, and thus resorted to begging to survive. He usually collected Rs. 5 to Rs. 6 daily in his small gunny bag.
*   **Setting:** Kondiba lived in "Golibar," a large slum colony in Ghatkopar, north-east of Mumbai, with Tukaram and Yelanbai.

### 2. The Dangerous Well
*   In the middle of the colony was a well, which the residents had dug two years earlier because the single water tap was insufficient for the growing population.
*   The well was highly dangerous: it had no wall around it, its mouth had gradually widened, and the bottom was narrow, muddy, and filled with weeds. The water was blackish-green, and nothing could be seen far below the surface.

## Part 2: The Act of Bravery

The core of the story revolves around a sudden crisis and Kondiba’s immediate, selfless reaction.

### The Drowning Incident
1.  **The Call for Help:** Kondiba was having his half-eaten meal when he suddenly heard shouts and great confusion. A woman cried out, “Someone’s fallen in the well!”.
2.  **Kondiba’s Response:** Without hesitation, Kondiba set aside his meal and said urgently, "Quick, lead me there". He pushed his way through the small crowd, pulled off his shirt, and slipped into the water.
3.  **The Victim:** The boy who had fallen was named Arvind. He had fallen off a tree trunk while drawing water. Two other boys were paddling around but could not dive.

### The Difficult Rescue
Kondiba was physically weak due to years of poverty, but he had been a good swimmer before losing his sight.

*   **Dive 1 (Assessment):** Kondiba took a deep breath and dived. He carefully felt his way along the rocky sides to the bottom, where his feet sank into soft mud. He felt only mud and slippery weeds. Tired and breathless, he surfaced without the boy. Arvind’s aunt was wailing.
*   **Dive 2 (Deep Search):** He took another deep breath and vanished into the muddy depths. He used the shape knowledge gained from the first dive. He searched the bottom, slipping in the mud and getting caught in the weeds, but found no sign of Arvind. When he surfaced, the crowd gave a sigh of disappointment.
*   **The Final Push:** Kondiba was extremely tired; his ribs were aching, and he couldn't hold his breath much longer. He desperately wished he could see, though he didn't know the water was too muddy for anyone to see. He knew he was Arvind’s "only hope" and reasoned that Arvind "must be here".
*   **The Discovery:** Just as he was about to give up and kick himself up, his finger felt something soft among the weeds—Arvind’s cloth, and then his legs. The boy’s body was held tight in the mud and weeds ("the net").
*   **Securing the Boy:** His heart beating painfully, Kondiba needed to breathe badly. He desperately felt for something to grip and found Arvind’s belt. Holding it tightly, he pulled the boy free and struggled upwards against the pain in his spine and muscles.
*   **Success:** It seemed a long time before he rose the six metres to the surface. Other hands quickly lifted Arvind out. After Arvind began to vomit water, cries of joy came from the crowd.

## Part 3: Recognition and Change

Kondiba’s courageous action led to a profound change in his own life.

*   **Recovery:** Arvind was hurried to the hospital. A police officer later confirmed that Arvind would be alright, noting that Kondiba had saved him just in time, preventing potential brain damage from lack of oxygen.
*   **Gratitude:** The next afternoon, Arvind returned to the colony and touched Kondiba’s feet in gratitude.
*   **Fame and Reward:** Although Kondiba assumed his life must "go on" as a beggar, word of his bravery spread quickly. His picture and the story of his daring rescue were published in many national and local papers, and he became a hero. He was praised by the Governor and Chief Minister of Maharashtra and received rewards totalling Rs. 12,970.
*   **Self-Reliance:** He utilized his reward money and learned new skills like bottling and the weaving of chair seats while living temporarily in a Home for the Blind.
*   **New Life:** Today, Kondiba lives in Jalna, runs a small business, and is married. His bravery and determination proved that nothing could stop him from success, and he never had to beg again.

## Part 4: Key Learning Concepts

### 1. Defining the Hero
The lesson defines heroes as people who, despite their own difficulties, are ready to help others. Kondiba demonstrated **bravery, compassion, the ability to take a decision in a crisis, and determination** (not giving up hope).

### 2. Differently-Abled People and Society
This lesson provides a crucial social commentary on people with disabilities, who are now referred to as **differently-abled**.

*   **Equality and Rights:** Every individual, including those who are differently-abled, is unique and has different abilities that must be recognized and valued. They have the same feelings and emotions as anyone else and should be treated fairly and as equals, as this is their constitutional right.
*   **Societal Responsibility:** Society must not underestimate differently-abled people, as they possess special talents and capabilities. The challenge often lies not in the person's disability, but in the infrastructure (like stairs) or defects in design that create difficulties.
*   The **Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995**, holds the State responsible for ensuring the protection of rights, education, employment, and rehabilitation of people with disabilities.

## Part 5: Language Focus

The lesson focuses heavily on describing actions that took place in the past.

### 1. Verbs in the Past Tense
Verbs are studied in the context of sequence of events.

*   **Simple Past Tense:** Used to talk about an event that took place at a specific point in the past, using the second form of the verb (e.g., Kondiba *hated* begging; he *came* to Mumbai; he *failed* to earn much).
*   **Past Perfect Tense:** Used to describe an action that was completed *before* another action in the past. This is formed using **had + the third form** of the verb.
    *   *Example:* If Arvind **had not fallen** into the well, Kondiba **would not have dived** in. The falling happened before the diving.

### 2. Phrasal Verbs
A phrasal verb is a simple verb combined with an adverb or a preposition (or both) to create a new verb with a meaning distinct from the simple verb.

| Phrasal Verb (Example) | Meaning in Context | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **go on** | To continue (Kondiba’s life had to *go on*) | |
| **pull off** | To remove or take off (He *pulled off* his shirt) | |
| **run out of** | To finish a supply of something (He had *run out of* breath) | |
| **fall into** | To drop inside (A boy had *fallen into* the well) | |
| **push through** | To force a way through (Kondiba *pushed through* the crowd) | |
| **give up** | To stop trying (He did not *give up* hope) | |

### 3. Writing and Description
The lesson also teaches how to describe a person by focusing on different characteristics:
1.  **Physical features** (built, height, hair, dress).
2.  **Nature** (psychological attributes and values, like bravery or compassion).
3.  **Habits and expressions** (like a smiling face or a twinkle in the eyes).
