## Lesson 6: A Tiger Comes to Town-II

### Part 1: Objectives and Context

This part of the story begins where Part I ended: the runaway circus tiger is asleep under the Headmaster’s desk, and the teachers have locked the room from the outside.

#### Key Learning Objectives
After reading this part of the story, you will be able to:
*   Enjoy the continuation of the story "A Tiger Comes to Town".
*   Challenge common myths and superstitions related to animals.
*   Write an appropriate reply to a letter of complaint.
*   Convert sentences into reported speech.
*   Use prefixes and contractions effectively.
*   Evaluate a situation from different perspectives.
*   Enhance your vocabulary of antonyms.

#### The Core Conflict
The problem in this lesson becomes complicated because of a lack of proper information and an incorrect understanding of the situation. The teachers and townspeople operate based on the fixed idea that **tigers are ferocious animals to be feared**. They do not understand the true nature and habits of the tiger, despite the circus Master's assurances.

## Part 2: The Tiger Wakes Up and the Standoff

The conflict arises when the tiger wakes up, and the people refuse to allow the Master, who is unarmed, to enter the room.

### 1. The Tiger’s Actions
*   The tiger awoke after a very good **stretch** (span of time) of sleep and heard voices outside.
*   He saw the Headmaster **cowering** (shrinking back in fear) in the attic.
*   The tiger **stretched himself** (put out his arms and legs) and **roared** (made a loud sound) for no particular reason other than that he felt alive.
*   He wished to **assure** (convince) the poor human in the loft that he was not going to hurt him.
*   He raised himself, put his **forelegs** (front legs) on the wall, scratched it, and **growled** softly, which only made the already nervous Headmaster **tremble** (shake with fear) more.

### 2. The Master’s Requests and the Teachers’ Fear
The Master, who was outside, could hear the tiger and knew he had to get him out quickly.

*   The Master requested, "One of you take a ladder in and help the headmaster come down from the attic".
*   He stated he was going into the room as he was, "without arms or **protection**" (something which keeps you safe).
*   The people outside immediately asked why he was going in unarmed, fearing the tiger could kill him.

### 3. The Magistrate's Interference
The teachers call the Magistrate, the Chairman of the "Tiger Committee," to stop the Master.

*   The Chairman, using the **authority** (power to enforce obedience) of his position as an Honorary Magistrate, gave the Master **notice** (warning) that he could not open or enter the room.
*   When the Master asked why they were preventing him, they claimed: **“It’s unlawful to commit suicide”**.
*   The Master argued that circus people approach tigers all the time, and he was risking his own life, not theirs. This statement that he knew how to **tame a tiger** and was risking his life **confused and bewildered** the Chairman.

***

## Part 3: The Affidavit and the Master’s Lesson

The Chairman, confused but determined to protect the authorities, imposed a legal condition.

### 1. The Legal Demand
*   The Chairman demanded that the Master sign an **affidavit** (a legal written statement) **absolving** (freeing from blame) them from all responsibility for his life or death.
*   The affidavit, which the Magistrate dictated, was meant to ensure that no one would be held responsible if the tiger attacked or injured the Master.

### 2. The Master’s Sarcasm and Sanskrit
The Master was angry that his credibility was doubted, especially after the teachers had called the tiger a "brute" in Part I.

*   The Master signed the document to "respect the **magistracy**" (magistrate's position), but commented that the document was **uncalled for** (not required) and **irrelevant** (not important).
*   He deliberately wrote the affidavit in **Sanskrit**, the language of the gods and the scriptures, which the Magistrate and teachers could not read.
*   **The Master’s Intent:** He wanted to teach the learned Magistrate and teachers a lesson: if they could not understand an ancient human language, their assumptions about the tiger’s behaviour must also be **flawed**.

### 3. The Master’s Final Advice to the Tiger
After signing the document (which the Magistrate finally accepted because Sanskrit is one of the official languages of India), the Master unlocked the door and prepared to leave with the tiger.

*   The Master told the tiger, "You must realise that human beings, for all their **bluster** (angry or empty threats) are **timid** creatures. They are likely to panic when they see you".
*   The crucial advice the Master gave his tiger was: **"Don’t look at them. That’s the only way to maintain one’s peace of mind"**.

## Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

### 1. Prefixes
A prefix is a group of letters added *before* a word to change its meaning.
*   *Example:* Adding ‘ir’ to *relevant* makes it **irrelevant**, meaning insignificant.
*   *Example:* Adding ‘in’ to *human* makes it **inhuman**, meaning cruel or not fit for human beings.

### 2. Contractions
Contractions are short forms used in spoken and informal English, combining two words using an apostrophe to replace an omitted letter.
*   *Examples:* *I am* $\to$ **I’m**; *will not* $\to$ **won’t**; *could not* $\to$ **couldn’t**.

### 3. Direct and Indirect (Reported) Speech
This lesson focuses on converting different types of sentences into indirect speech.

*   **Statements:** The listener (Reporter) reports what the Speaker said, often changing pronouns and verb tenses (e.g., *I have* $\to$ *he had*).
*   **Imperative Sentences (Commands/Advice):** The reporting verb changes to reflect the command or advice given.
    *   *Direct:* "I order you not to enter the room."
    *   *Indirect:* The Magistrate **ordered him not to enter** the room.
    *   *Direct:* "Don’t look at them."
    *   *Indirect:* The Master **told the tiger not to look** at them.
*   **Interrogative Sentences (Questions):** The question is rephrased as a statement using 'why', 'what', 'if', or 'whether'.
    *   *Direct:* "Why do you prevent me from going near the tiger?"
    *   *Indirect:* The Master **asked why he was being prevented** from going near the tiger.
