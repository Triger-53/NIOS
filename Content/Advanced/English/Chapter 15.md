## Lesson 15: My Vision for India (Based on a speech by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam)

### Part 1: Objectives and Context

The lesson is designed to inspire individuals to contribute to national development by internalizing Dr. Kalam's goals.

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   **Appreciate** Dr. Kalam’s vision for India.
*   **Identify an individual’s role** in India’s development.
*   Use identical pairs of words having different meanings in sentences of your own.
*   Use **modals** appropriately.
*   Write a descriptive paragraph.

#### The Inspiration
On national days like Republic Day and Independence Day, speeches inform us about the nation's progress and new government initiatives for continuous development. Dr. Kalam’s speech is intended to make readers feel inspired and enthusiastic, encouraging them to contribute to making India one of the best nations in the world.

### Part 2: Dr. Kalam’s Three Visions for India

Dr. Kalam outlines his three primary goals ("visions") for the nation.

#### 1. First Vision: Freedom
Dr. Kalam begins by reviewing India's long history.
*   **Historical Context:** In 3000 years of history, people from all over the world—including the Greeks (Alexander), the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British, the French, and the Dutch—have come and **invaded, captured lands, conquered minds, looted us, and took over what was ours**.
*   **India’s Difference:** Despite being invaded, India has **not done this to any other nation**. India has not conquered anyone, nor has it grabbed their land, culture, or history, or tried to enforce its way of life on them.
*   **The Reason:** India has never invaded others because **"we respect the freedom of others"**.
*   **The Vision:** Dr. Kalam's **FIRST VISION is FREEDOM**. He believes India first saw this vision in **1857**, with the start of the War of Independence. He states that this freedom must be protected, nurtured (taken care of), and built upon. If India is not free, **no one will respect us**.

#### 2. Second Vision: Development
Dr. Kalam argues that India needs to shed its perception as a "developing" nation.
*   **Current Achievements:** India has a **10 percent growth rate in most areas**, poverty levels are falling, and achievements are being **globally recognised** today. India is among the **top five nations in the world in terms of GDP**.
*   **The Lack:** Despite these successes, India **lacks the self-confidence** to see itself as a developed nation, self-reliant, and self-assured.
*   **The Vision:** Dr. Kalam’s **SECOND VISION for India is DEVELOPMENT**. After fifty years of being a developing nation, it is time for India to see itself as a developed nation.

#### 3. Third Vision: Stand Up to the World (Strength)
This vision emphasizes the necessity of being strong to earn global respect.
*   **The Requirement for Respect:** Dr. Kalam believes that **unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us**. He states, **"Only strength respects strength"**.
*   **The Vision:** India must be strong not only as a **military power** but also as an **economic power**. Both must advance together ("go hand-in-hand").

### Part 3: The Role of the Citizen (Stop Complaining)

Dr. Kalam argues that citizens must stop perpetually complaining and take responsibility for national development.

#### 1. The Young Girl’s Goal
When giving a lecture in Hyderabad, Dr. Kalam met a 14-year-old girl whose goal in life was to **"live in a developed India"**. He emphasizes that achieving this goal requires everyone—"you and I"—to build this developed India.

#### 2. The Culture of Complaint
Dr. Kalam lists many common complaints he hears from Indians:
*   The government is **inefficient**.
*   Laws are too old.
*   The municipality does not pick up the **garbage** (rubbish).
*   Phones don’t work, railways are a joke, the airline is the worst, and mails never reach their destination.
*   The country is the "absolute pits" (depths).
*   He asks: "You say, say and say. **What do you do about it?**".

#### 3. The Call to Action
Dr. Kalam echoes the famous words of J.F. Kennedy:
*   **"ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY"**.
*   He urges Indians to **stop complaining** about problems and to start working towards creating a better India.
*   Instead of calling India underdeveloped, every Indian must **proclaim (declare) that "India is not an under-developed nation; it is a highly developed nation"**.

### Part 4: Personal Contributions and Achievements

Dr. Kalam highlights his own professional experiences and the importance of scientific contribution.

*   **Great Minds:** Dr. Kalam considered it his "good fortune" to have worked closely with three great minds:
    1.  **Dr. Vikram Sarabhai**, of the Department of Space.
    2.  **Professor Satish Dhawan**, who succeeded Sarabhai in the Department of Space.
    3.  **Dr. Brahm Prakash**, the father of Nuclear Technology/Nuclear material.

*   **Dr. Kalam’s Biography:** Dr. Kalam (born in Rameshwaram on October 15, 1931) served as the **11th President of India** (2002–2007) and was known as the People's President. He overcame childhood financial problems. He was the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He was associated with the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (I.G.M.D.P) and was honoured with India’s highest civilian awards, including the **Bharat Ratna in 1997**.

### Part 5: Language and Grammar Focus

#### 1. Modals
Modals are underlined words that express ability, possibility, permission, orders, duties, or intentions.

*   **Can/Could:** Used to talk about **possibilities** or express **ability**. *Could* is often used for seeking polite permission.
*   **Will/Would:** Used for making **predictions**, insisting, or stating **intentions**. *Would* is the past form of *will* and is used for polite speech.
*   **Must:** Used to express **obligation** or **duty**. *Example: We must use our right to vote thoughtfully*.

#### 2. Identical Pairs of Words with Different Meanings
The lesson emphasizes that the same word can convey different meanings based on context (often confusing it with the concept of homographs).

| Word | Meaning 1 (Context A) | Meaning 2 (Context B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Catch** | To grasp the meaning (Try to *catch* the meaning) | A dropped ball in cricket (*catch* of Raman Manglam) |
| **Goal** | An ambition/aim (Udyan’s *goal* is to become a judge) | A score point in a game (highest number of *goals*) |
| **Note** | To record information (Ameena Bano *noted* down her homework) | Currency (A new 500 rupee *note*) |
| **Post** | To send mail (Mridula went to *post* a letter) | A job position (apply for the *post* of Legal Advisor) |
