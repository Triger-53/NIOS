## Lesson 4: Tall Trees (Poem by Eileen Mathias)

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

The primary goal of this lesson is to help you read and enjoy the poem, understand its theme, and identify specific literary and linguistic concepts.

#### Key Objectives:
*   **Explain the theme** of the poem.
*   **Identify 'personification'** and explain how it relates the poem to the world of humans.
*   Recognise the values of **caring and protection** expressed by Nature.
*   Identify words that **rhyme** (ending in similar sounds) and understand how they create rhythm.
*   Feel the **strong presence of Nature** everywhere.

#### The Theme: Humility and Protection
The poet uses the image of tall trees to convey a message about human values. The trees are strong, tall, and powerful, yet they are not proud. They offer selfless care and protection to all. The lesson suggests that **human beings who are tall and powerful should also be humble and caring** like the trees.

### Part 2: Understanding the Poem (Stanza by Stanza)

The poem presents an integrated and harmonious picture of nature where various elements (clouds, birds, moon) work closely together for others' welfare.

#### Stanza 1: Observation and Personification
> *With their feet in the earth*
> *And their heads in the sky*
> *The tall trees watch*
> *The clouds go by*

*   **Personification:** The poet gives the trees human attributes—**feet** and **heads**—and says they **watch** the clouds passing by. This is used to convey that the trees are **very, very tall** (their heads are in the sky).
*   **The Meaning of "Feet in the Earth":** In the context of the trees, this means their **roots are going under the ground to give them a strong hold**.
*   **Metaphor for Humans:** In the context of a person who is powerful or successful, having one's "feet on the ground" means that they **do not lose their head over their success or power**; they remain humble and remember they are ordinary.

#### Stanza 2: Shelter and Care
> *When the dusk sends quickly*
> *The birds to rest*
> *The tall trees shelter them*
> *Safe in a nest*

*   **Time of Day:** The time referred to here is the **dusk** (evening), which drives the birds to their homes.
*   **Integrated Nature:** The poet creates an integrated picture where the darkening sky (dusk) drives the birds, and the trees offer comfort and **shelter** in their nests.
*   **Personification Examples:** The dusk is seen as a person "sending away" the birds, and the trees are actively "sheltering" them.

#### Stanza 3: Guardianship and Watchfulness
> *And then in the night*
> *With the tall trees peeping,*
> *The moon shines down*
> *On a world that’s sleeping*

*   **Protection:** The trees stay awake to **keep a watch over the world as it sleeps**. They are portrayed as **protectors and guardians** in whose care the world can sleep safely and soundly.
*   **The Moon’s Role:** Besides the trees, the **moon** is also taking loving care of the world by **spreading her soft light** over the sleeping world at night.
*   **Peeping:** In this context, "peeping" means **looking or watching**.

### Part 3: Language and Literary Devices

The lesson highlights two main literary concepts:

#### 1. Personification
Personification is a literary device where you speak of a thing (which is not human) as if it were a living being. It involves applying human qualities and feelings to non-human things to create a vivid picture.

*   **Examples from the poem:**
    *   Trees have **feet** and **heads**.
    *   Trees **watch** the clouds.
    *   Trees **shelter** the birds.
    *   Trees are **peeping** in the night.

*   **Common Examples (for practice):**
    *   "Books are our best friends".
    *   "Love is blind/divine".
    *   "Opportunity knocks only once".
    *   "Time waits for none".

#### 2. Rhyme and Rhythm
Rhyme is the use of **similar sounds at the end of lines** in a poem.

*   **Function:** Rhyme lends a **flow and a rhythm** to the lines, making them catchy and easy to remember.
*   **Rhyming Pairs from the Poem:**
    *   sky – **by**
    *   rest – **nest**
    *   peeping – **sleeping**

### Part 4: General Knowledge about Trees

The lesson includes fascinating facts about real-life trees:

*   **Height:** Most tall trees in India grow to about **40 feet**.
*   **World’s Tallest:** The three accepted tallest species are the Coast Redwood (California, USA, 379.1 feet), Australian Mountain Ash (Tasmania, Australia, 326.8 feet), and Coast Douglas Fir (Oregon, USA, 326.1 feet).
*   **Oldest Known Planted Tree:** The **Shri Maha Bodhi Sacred Tree** in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, is the oldest human-planted tree with a known planting date (2293 years old). It grew from a cutting of the original Bodhi Tree in Gaya.
