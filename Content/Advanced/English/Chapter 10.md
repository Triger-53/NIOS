That is an excellent request! Just as we covered the "Snake Bite" lesson, we will now explore the details of the lesson titled **"NOISE: HOW IT AFFECTS OUR LIVES."**

This lesson teaches you how to understand the difference between everyday sound and harmful noise, its scientific measurement, its dangerous effects on the body, and practical steps we can take to achieve a quieter world.

## Lesson 10: Noise: How it Affects Our Lives

### Part 1: Objectives and Definitions

The main goals of this lesson are for you to learn how to discriminate between **sound** and **noise** and recognize the noise that can be avoided. You will also learn to identify and use homophones, define and form compound words, and practice making verbal complaints.

#### What is Sound and What is Noise?

1.  **Sound vs. Noise:** Every morning, we wake up to various sounds, such as the chirping of birds or the chime of a clock. While some sounds are pleasant and melodious, others are unpleasant and harsh.
2.  **Definition of Noise:** **Any unpleasant sound is noise**. It is something we don’t like and something that makes us cover our ears.
3.  **Examples of Noise:** The wail (loud cry) of a fire engine, a clap of thunder, and the screech (harsh sound) of a car’s tyres when the brakes are applied suddenly are all examples of noise.

#### Measuring Sound Scientifically

To determine how much sound is too much, sound can be measured scientifically.

*   **Unit of Measurement:** The level of sound is measured in **decibels**.
*   **Instrument:** A **decibel meter** is used to register this level.
*   **Zero Decibel (0 dB):** This is equal to the faintest sound that can be heard by the human ear.
*   **Comfortable Levels (45–75 dB):** Most people speak within this range, which is comfortable for our ears. A quiet bedroom registers around 35 decibels.

#### When Sound Becomes Dangerous Noise

Noise levels become dangerous and harmful once they pass certain thresholds.

*   **85 Decibels (85 dB):** At this level, **noise damages ears**.
*   **100 Decibels (100 dB):** Hearing loss can begin when the noise level goes above this mark.
*   **140 Decibels (140 dB):** Actual pain is felt at this level, although some people may experience pain even lower.

### Part 2: How Noise Affects Our Lives

Noise pollution affects our bodies and minds, often without us realizing it immediately.

#### Noise as a Pollutant

Noise pollutes our environment just as much as smoke, foul water, dirty air, and litter. It is considered a major threat to the quality of human lives.

*   **Health Effects:** Continuous exposure to noise can cause **illness and deafness**.
*   **The Body's Reaction:** The human body **never gets used to noise**. Even if a person (like Naseer, who boasted he could sleep through traffic) thinks they don't hear the noise, their body continues to react to the stress while they sleep.
*   **Specific Physical Harm:** Research shows that sounds heard while a person is asleep can cause danger to their hearts and blood vessels. Noise causes the **blood vessels in the brain to expand**, which brings on pain and causes headaches.
*   **Hearing Damage:** It is the **length of time** (often hours and hours) of being exposed to loud noises that damages the sensitive part of the inner ear. For example, players in a rock band exposed to music ranging from 105 to 115 decibels for many hours suffered from hearing loss and partial deafness.

### Part 3: What We Can Do to Reduce Noise

The lesson emphasizes that if we start thinking about the harmful effects of noise, we will become quieter ourselves.

#### Actions You Can Take

There are many steps individuals can take to cut down noise:

1.  **Be Conscious of Actions:** Instead of slamming books on a desk, place them quietly. Instead of walking noisily through the halls, walk quietly.
2.  **Manage Devices:** At home, use only one mechanical device (like a vacuum cleaner or washing machine) at a time. Turn down stereos, radios, tape recorders, and television sets, and do not turn on more than one at the same time.
3.  **Community Awareness:** We should try to talk softly, not shout at each other, and observe silence for some time daily.
4.  **Traffic and Festivals:** Avoid honking horns as far as possible, and switch off car or scooter engines at red lights. Avoid bursting crackers even during festivals, functions, and ceremonies, as the noise made by exploding crackers can cause permanent hearing loss.

#### Laws and Regulations

Progress is being made towards a quieter world through government regulations.

*   The **Supreme Court** passed an order on July 18, 2005, banning noise from all sources at night and restricting noise in all public places during the day.
*   Creating noise is a **violation** of the Supreme Court’s directions.
*   Using loudspeakers without Police Permission between **10 p.m. and 6 a.m.** is punishable.
*   Noise is illegal in **silence zones** and is an offense punishable under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

### Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

The lesson uses the topic of noise to teach specific language skills.

#### 1. Homophones

Homophones are words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings (literally meaning "same sound").

| Example Pair | Meaning Example | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brakes** / **Breaks** | We applied the *brakes* (car stopping mechanism). Don’t *break* (shatter) the glass. | |
| **Heard** / **Herd** | Sumeet *heard* (listened) that he got a job. The dog chased the *herd* (group) of sheep. | |
| **Pain** / **Pane** | He has a sharp *pain* in his knee. The window *panes* (sheets of glass) were strong. | |
| **Bare** / **Bear** | I can’t *bear* (tolerate) having cats. Everyone must have the *bare* (basic) necessities. | |

#### 2. Compound Words

Compound words are formed by combining two (or sometimes more) words to create a new word. These words lose their independent meaning and function as a single unit.

*   **Examples from the text:** *vacuum cleaner*, *washing machine*, *tape-recorder*.
*   **Types of Compound Words:**
    *   **Closed:** Written without a space (e.g., *afternoon*, *pickpocket*).
    *   **Open:** Written with a space (e.g., *fancy dress*, *mother tongue*).
    *   **Hyphenated:** Written with a hyphen (e.g., *man-eater*, *baby-sitter*).

#### 3. Question Formation

The lesson covers two types of questions:

1.  **'Wh' Questions:** These start with words like *What*, *When*, *Why*, *Which*, or *How* and require a detailed answer.
    *   *Example:* **What** is a decibel zero sound equal to?.
2.  **'Yes/No' Questions:** These begin with words like 'Do', 'Is', or 'Can' and can *only* be answered with "yes" or "no".
    *   *Example:* **Do** you think noise can cause any damage?.
