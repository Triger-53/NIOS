I would be delighted to provide a full, detailed explanation of the lesson titled **"My Elder Brother."** This short story, written by Leo Tolstoy (excerpted from his novel *Boyhood*), explores the complex relationship between two young brothers, focusing on themes of jealousy, superiority, forgiveness, and the dignity of humility.

## Lesson 11: My Elder Brother

### Part 1: Objectives and Context

The short story is described as an exciting literary form that is brief and often has an unexpected ending. This specific story details the initial relationship between two siblings and how a significant change in their behaviour occurs as the narrative develops.

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Analyse the behaviour and attitude of the two main characters (Nicky and Valodya).
*   Explain the interpersonal relationships between siblings.
*   Recognise the **importance of forgiveness in relationships** and integrate it into daily behaviour.
*   Identify and define the functions of **noun clauses**.
*   Record significant experiences in a diary or a learning journal.

#### The Characters
The story is narrated by the younger brother, **Nicky**, and focuses on his interactions with his older brother, **Valodya**.

### Part 2: The Initial Relationship (Nicky's Anguish)

Initially, the two brothers were close, growing up, studying, and playing together with "no distinction of elder and younger". However, as the story begins, the younger brother, Nicky, starts to feel inferior to Valodya.

#### 1. Nicky’s Feelings of Inferiority and Vanity
*   **The Difference:** Nicky began to realise he was "no companion" for Valodya in age, interests, or ability.
*   **Valodya’s Superiority:** Nicky felt Valodya was better than him in "everything"—at lessons, in arguments, and in manners.
*   **The Cause of Hurt:** This perceived difference caused Nicky "moral anguish". This feeling of inadequacy led to tension in their relationship.
*   **The New Shirt:** A major point of Nicky's suffering was when Valodya received a tucked linen shirt for the first time. Nicky admits his unhappiness was inspired by his **vanity** (false pride). He was convinced that every time Valodya arranged his collar, it was done deliberately to annoy him.
*   **Misunderstanding:** Nicky was most tormented by the suspicion that Valodya understood his inner turmoil but tried to hide it. Nicky acknowledged that this idea may have been wrong, inspired by his own "sensitiveness and tendency to analyse".

#### 2. Valodya’s Personality and Hobbies
Valodya is described as **impulsive** (acting without thinking about the result) and his enthusiasms or hobbies did not last long.
*   **Changing Hobbies:** His passions shifted frequently: first, a passion for pictures and painting, then a craze for curios (works of art valued for being unusual) to decorate his table, and finally, a mania (extreme enthusiasm) for novels.
*   **Nicky’s Envy:** Nicky was impressed by Valodya's hobbies but was too **proud** to imitate him and too young to choose one for himself.
*   **Valodya’s Best Quality:** Nicky envied nothing so much as Valodya’s **happy large heartedness** (generosity/caring), which was most strikingly evident when they quarrelled. Nicky always felt that Valodya "was behaving well".

***

### Part 3: The Quarrel and the Aftermath

The intense conflict occurs when Nicky accidentally breaks one of Valodya’s treasured possessions.

#### 1. The Incident
*   When Valodya's passion for ornaments was "at its height" (utmost degree), Nicky went to his table and accidentally broke an empty bright-coloured little scent bottle.
*   **Valodya’s Reaction:** Valodya demanded to know who had touched his things, seeing the symmetry (balance) of his treasures upset. He looked at the broken pieces **sorrowfully**.
*   **Nicky’s Reaction:** Nicky retorted (said sharply) that Valodya should not "issue orders" and smiled, though he did not feel like smiling. This forced smile was Nicky's way of pretending he was not bothered, which further annoyed Valodya.
*   **Escalation:** Valodya, calling Nicky a "nasty little **brat**" (a child who behaves badly), pushed him away. In a fit of uncontrollable anger ("beside myself"), Nicky grabbed the leg of the table and **tipped it over** (tilted it). All of Valodya’s china and glass ornaments "crashed to the floor".
*   **The Break:** Nicky left the room thinking, "Well, now it is all over between us," and they had "quarreled for good" (forever).

#### 2. Reconciliation and Forgiveness
After the fight, Nicky was scared, uncomfortable, and **ashamed** to be alone with his brother. He felt uneasy because he knew he was in the wrong and was guilty, fearing the fight would come up again.

*   **Valodya’s Gesture:** When Nicky passed him later that evening, he put on an angry expression ("scowled"). However, Valodya raised his head and looked him "full in the face" with a **meaningful smile**. Valodya understood Nicky's feelings.
*   **The Apology:** Valodya then spoke to him in a "most natural voice without a scrap of pathos" (a little bit of pity). Valodya asked for forgiveness, **"Forgive me if I offended you"**, and held out his hand.
*   **Nicky’s Repentance:** Valodya’s large-hearted gesture touched Nicky deeply. Nicky felt pressure in his chest that stopped his breath, followed by tears. He stammered an apology: "Forgive… m-me, Val-dya," squeezing his brother's hand.
*   **The Change:** Nicky’s tears were tears of **sorrow and repentance**. This action showed a positive development in Nicky's character, as he accepted his mistake and apologised, proving he was also capable of changing for the better.

The lesson emphasizes that Valodya was not truly proud; Nicky's perception was born out of his own **vanity**. Valodya’s ability to forgive and ask for forgiveness demonstrated his large heart and made him the more likeable character.

### Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

#### 1. Noun Clauses (Grammar)
The lesson focuses on **clauses**, which are groups of words with a subject and a predicate (a finite verb). A complex sentence consists of an **Independent Clause** (can stand alone) and one or more **Dependent (Subordinate) Clauses** (cannot stand alone).

A **Noun Clause** is a type of subordinate clause that functions like a noun or pronoun in the sentence.

*   **Function:** Noun clauses commonly function as the **object to the main verb**.
    *   *Example:* Nicky realized (what?) **that he was jealous of Valodya**. (The noun clause is the object of the verb *realized*).
    *   *Example:* I knew (what?) **that he understood me**. (The noun clause is the object of the verb *knew*).

#### 2. Writing Skills (Diary/Learning Journal)
A diary or a learning journal is a tool to record experiences, helping you recall memories and understand how those experiences shape your personality. When writing a diary entry, you should include:
*   The date and time.
*   The event and the actions of the people involved.
*   The consequences of the event.
*   Your feelings of regret, shame, joy, etc..

#### 3. Forgiveness (Moral Value)
The lesson stresses that forgiveness is an essential virtue, aligning with various world religions.
*   **Hinduism:** Emphasizes *prayashchita* (atonement) and seeking forgiveness.
*   **Christianity:** Teaches forgiveness, noting that Jesus Christ asked for God’s forgiveness for his executioners.
*   **General Principle:** Forgiveness is the most effective tool to conquer even the "staunchest enemy" and helps to "take away the anger and jealousy, and heal the hurt".
