This comprehensive lesson covers the poem **"Nine Gold Medals"** by David Roth. The poem uses the setting of a track race to explore the deeper human values of empathy, cooperation, and prioritizing kindness over the spirit of individual competition.

Here is a full, detailed breakdown of the lesson:

## Lesson 9: Nine Gold Medals

### Part 1: Objectives and Central Idea

The lesson is structured to help you appreciate poetry, understand moral values, and recognize literary techniques.

#### 1. Central Idea and Theme
Sports are not only about winning medals; they are also about learning the values of **cooperation, sharing, competing, and complementing**. The poet, David Roth, presents the idea of **empathy** and argues that human values are as important as the spirit of competition. The core message is that sharing and caring are as important as winning and achieving.

#### 2. Key Objectives
After studying this poem, you will be able to:
*   State the central idea of the poem.
*   State how the players displayed their sensitivity towards one another.
*   Sum up the incident described in the poem.
*   Give the meanings of the metaphors used.
*   Explain the significance of the title of the poem.
*   Enjoy reading poetry and say how it is different from prose.

#### 3. Special Olympics Context
The setting of the poem is the **Special Olympics**. This international organization is created to help people with intellectual disabilities develop self-confidence, social skills, and a sense of personal accomplishment. The setting ensures that the contestants already embody determination and effort.

### Part 2: The Race and the Incident (Stanzas 1–5)

The poem begins by establishing the atmosphere of intense competition leading up to the unexpected turning point.

#### 1. Preparation and Setting
*   **The Athletes:** The athletes had come from all over the country to compete for the gold, silver, and bronze medals. They had spent many weeks and months training for these games.
*   **The Event:** The final and most prestigious event of the day was the **hundred-yard dash**. There were nine determined ("resolved") athletes lined up at the starting blocks.
*   **The Start:** Excitement was high. The signal was given, and the starting **pistol exploded**, causing the runners to charge ahead immediately ("so did the runners").

#### 2. The Turning Point
The turning point of the poem occurs right after the race begins.

*   **The Fall:** The smallest athlete among them stumbled, lost his balance ("staggered"), and fell onto the black tarred road ("asphalt") instead of running.
*   **Anguish:** He cried out in frustration and anguish (pain and disappointment). All his efforts and dreams of winning the medal were shattered ("dashed in the dirt"), as he could not take part in the race.

### Part 3: Empathy and The New Finish (Stanzas 6–8)

The remaining eight contestants react to their fellow athlete's pain in a way that goes against the spirit of cut-throat competition.

#### 1. The Decision to Stop
*   **Stopping:** The eight other runners, who had trained for so long, **stopped running** ("pulled up on their heels").
*   **The Rescue:** One by one, they all turned around and went back to help the fallen contestant. They brought the young boy to his feet, helping him stand up.

#### 2. The Walk of Unity
*   **Cooperation over Competition:** Because the fallen boy was unable to run, the others collectively decided not to run either.
*   **The New Race:** Then, all nine runners joined hands and continued the hundred-yard dash, which was **reduced to a walk**. They walked the distance at the speed of the contestant who had fallen down.
*   **The Banner:** This act of unity perfectly matched the banner above that said **'Special Olympics,'** emphasizing that the contest had become truly "special".

#### 3. The Result
*   **Nine Winners:** The race ended with **nine gold medals**. The authorities honoured their display of empathy, helpful nature, and human values by rewarding each contestant.
*   **Reaction:** They came to the finish line holding hands still. The spectators, moved by their exemplary behaviour, gave a **standing ovation** (standing up and clapping).
*   **Beaming Faces:** The "nine beaming faces" (very happy faces) showed that the contestants were happy and proud, not just because they won a medal, but because they had acted as a united group that stood by and helped each other, even at the cost of winning an individual prize.

### Part 4: Key Learning Concepts

#### 1. Empathy
The most important lesson learned is **empathy**.
*   **Definition:** Empathy is the capacity to understand another person’s experience from his point of view—the ability to **‘put oneself in another’s shoes’**.
*   **Application:** The eight contestants immediately applied empathy by thinking, “what would I have felt that stood by and helped each other, even at the cost of winning an individual prize.
