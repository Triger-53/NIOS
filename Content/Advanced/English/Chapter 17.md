That is a kind and conversational query! I am not tired, and I would be happy to provide you with a full, detailed explanation of the lesson titled **"CARING FOR OTHERS."**

This lesson focuses on love, empathy, and selfless service, using the examples of three incredible women: Mother Teresa, Janki Iyer, and a young girl named Bhagya.

## Lesson 17: Caring for Others

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

The lesson starts by defining the core concepts: **Love and care are two important feelings that bind us together**. The focus is on people who share their love with all of humanity, take care of those who are alone and helpless, and extend their hand to those in difficult situations without looking forward to any reward. Such people may be called "saviours of humanity".

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Recognize the **selfless services** of some great women.
*   Observe the **positive impact of love and care**.
*   Recognize the **need to sacrifice** for the benefit of humanity.
*   Develop self-awareness about how you make difficult choices and decisions.
*   State the purpose of taking an interview and frame questions for an interview.
*   Use the **adverb clause of time**.

#### Structure of the Lesson
The lesson is divided into three parts, each focusing on a different example of caring for others:
1.  An interview with **Mother Teresa**.
2.  A report about **Janki Iyer** and her school, Ananda Bharati.
3.  The story of a young girl called **Bhagya**.

### Part 2: Section I — Mother Teresa and the Dying

This section is an extract from an interview with the well-known journalist, Malcolm Muggeridge.

#### Mother Teresa’s Background and Service
*   **Origin and Arrival in India:** Mother Teresa was born in **South Yugoslavia**. At the age of nineteen, she came to Darjeeling, India, to teach.
*   **Mission:** In 1931, she decided to serve the poorest of the poor. She belonged to the order of **Missionaries of Charity**.
*   **Achievements:** For her services to the poor, she received the **Nobel Prize in 1979** and the **Bharat Ratna** (India's highest civilian award) by the Government of India in **1980**.
*   **Charitable Work:** Her order runs forty schools, educating about 30,000 children, and also operates mobile dispensaries, training centres, and destitute homes for the poor and needy.

#### Setting Up the Home for the Dying
*   **The First Rescue:** The first woman Mother Teresa saved was picked up from the street, where she had been **"half-eaten by the rats and the ants"**.
*   **Forcing the Hospital:** Mother Teresa took the woman to the hospital, but they could not do anything for her. They only accepted her because Mother Teresa **refused to move** until they admitted her.
*   **Founding the Home:** After this, Mother Teresa asked the municipality for a place to bring such abandoned people. The health officer took her to the **Kali Temple** and showed her a **dharamshala**. She was happy to have the place, and within twenty-four hours, they had patients there.
*   **Opening Date:** The first Home for the Dying was opened in **1952**.

#### Caring for the Dying and the Cured
*   **The Goal for the Dying:** The primary aim is to make the dying feel **wanted and loved** in the few hours they have left to live. They should know that they are the **children of God** and are not forgotten.
*   **The Cured:** Those who are cured and able to work are helped to find jobs. Others are sent home so they can spend at least a few years in happiness and comfort.

### Part 3: Section II — Janki Iyer and Ananda Bharati

This section tells the story of an older woman who dedicated herself to educating underprivileged girls.

#### Janki Iyer’s Service
*   **The School:** Janki Iyer runs a school called **Ananda Bharati**. The school is attached to her quiet house, which is called **Needa (refuge)**, near the Tarnaka crossroads.
*   **The Students:** She teaches girls who are **domestic servants** and cannot attend a formal school. These are often first-generation learners—the first in their family to receive education.
*   **Janki Iyer’s Character:** She is a **sprightly (active and lively) 70-year-old** woman. She is an **unassuming (modest, humble)**, soft-spoken, and gentle person.
*   **The Attitude:** Although it is a non-formal education centre, the author notes, "This is no non-formal education center" because the students and teachers are **very serious about education and examinations**, like a formal school. They use innovative teaching methods, field trips, and discussions on current events.
*   **Impact:** The children are **transformed into confident individuals**, and the values they imbibe stay with them. The school also combines studies with **vocational training**.

#### Teamwork and Support
*   **Attracting Professionals:** Janki Iyer attracts young professionals ("like bees to honey") to volunteer their time and effort. A computer professional handles accounts, a Linguistics professor teaches Hindi, another professor teaches English, and another teaches music.
*   **Diversity in Staff:** Despite the preponderance (superiority) of highly educated teachers, she retains teachers from **under-privileged backgrounds**.
*   **External Help:** When students need to go to residential schools or college, Janaki’s many friends help in sorting out the myriad (many) problems that arise. She is doing a **yeoman service** (useful service) to these domestic workers.

### Part 4: Section III — Bhagya’s Difficult Choice

This section tells the story of Bhagya, a young student at Ananda Bharati, who learns to prioritize her future.

#### Bhagya’s Responsibilities and Studies
*   **Background:** Bhagya is a **ten-year-old** girl who is poor and works as a part-time domestic helper. She has the responsibility of taking care of her two younger sisters, Swarna and baby Swapna.
*   **Transformation in Class:** When Bhagya comes to Janki Iyer’s class, which starts at 2 p.m., she **sheds her responsibilities** the instant she hands Swapna to Janki Iyer. She becomes interested in her work, whether it is an exercise in Telugu, sums, or drawing, just like any other child her age.
*   **Janki Iyer’s Help:** Janki Iyer takes Swapna onto her lap for her *siesta* (afternoon nap) or keeps her busy, sharing Bhagya's responsibilities so she can study.
*   **Earnings:** Bhagya started working for occupants of a flat, earning a little money. She used this money to buy a pair of rubber slippers, pretty green **bangles** (compared to Sarojini Naidu's "rainbow-tinted circles of light"), and new clothes.

#### The Difficult Choice
*   **The Conflict:** Bhagya was sometimes late to class due to her duties (cooking, looking after Swapna, and working in the flat). Janki Iyer would give her an **admonition (scolding)** because she did not want Bhagya to neglect her studies.
*   **The Offer:** Bhagya was offered additional work by a lady in a newly constructed apartment for a **hundred rupees per month** (a grand sum for her, which she called 'Vanda' in Telugu).
*   **Bhagya’s Decision:** Bhagya realized that taking the extra work would mean she **would not have time to study** in the afternoon. She made a **deliberate choice**, giving up the hundred rupees to study.
*   **Sharing the Opportunity:** Bhagya decided to give the job to Lakshmi, another student, instead.
*   **Remarkable Choice:** This choice was remarkable because she refused a large sum of money after thinking clearly about her goals and prioritizing **education over money**.

***

### Part 5: Language Focus (Adverb Clause of Time)

The lesson provides specific instruction on identifying and using adverb clauses of time.

#### Adverb Clause of Time
*   **Function:** An adverb clause of time tells us **about the time when a certain action is performed**. It answers the question ‘when’ about the main clause.
*   **Characteristics:** It begins with time-related words called **subordinating conjunctions** such as *whenever, while, after, before, since, when, as,* and *as soon as*.
*   **Structure:** Like any clause, it must have a **subject and a full verb (predicate)**.
    *   *Example:* I saw the movie **before I left for Jaipur**. (Subject: I; Verb: left).

#### Contrast with Adverbs
An adverb clause should not be confused with a simple adverb.
*   *Adverb:* I saw the movie **yesterday**. (*Yesterday* is a single word, not a clause).
*   *Adverb Clause:* I saw the movie **before I left for Jaipur**. (*Before I left for Jaipur* has a subject and a verb).

### Part 6: Communication Skills

The lesson briefly defines two important communication formats used in the text:

1.  **Interview:** A conversation between two or more persons where questions are asked by an interviewer to get information from an interviewee. It can be conducted to test suitability for a job, collect information about a famous person's work/life, or find out their opinion on social topics.
2.  **Report:** A presentation of information already collected through observation, interview, or other means. Key features include **relevant and accurate facts**, a **narrative style**, and **coherence**.
