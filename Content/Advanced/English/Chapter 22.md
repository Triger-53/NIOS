## Lesson 22: The Truth (Poem by Barrie Wade)

### Part 1: Objectives and Context

The lesson emphasizes the need for controlling strong emotions and ambitions to maintain a calm and peaceful attitude. Strong negative emotions, such as anger and jealousy, are destructive if left uncontrolled.

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Enjoy reading the poem.
*   Explain the **central idea of the poem**.
*   State the effect of harsh and impolite words on our mind and heart.
*   Justify the need for **effective communication** for problem-solving and positive relationships.
*   Identify the comparisons used to relate certain ideas in the poem.
*   Explain the literary devices used in the poem to create an impact on the reader.
*   Explain the significance of the title of the poem.
*   Analyse your own behaviour in reaction to a particular situation.

#### Wisdom from the *Atharva Veda*
The lesson quotes lines from the *Atharva Veda* to highlight the power of words. The *Atharva Veda* is one of the four Hindu scriptures (along with the Rig Veda, the Yajur Veda, and the Sam Veda), which Hindus believe hold the origin of all knowledge and wisdom.

The *Veda* states that words are powerful:
*   Words can confer strength.
*   They can drown strength off.
*   Words can gain friends.
*   They can turn friends into enemies.
*   Words can elevate or lower the individual.
*   Therefore, one must learn the habit of making one's words **sweet, soft, and pleasant**.

### Part 2: Understanding the Poem

The poem, "Truth" by Barrie Wade, explores how emotional pain inflicted by words is far more damaging and lasting than physical injury.

#### Stanza 1: Physical vs. Emotional Pain
> *Sticks and stones may break my bones*
> *But words can also hurt me.*
> *Stones and sticks break only skin*
> *While words are ghosts that haunt me.*

*   **Physical Injury:** Objects like **sticks and stones** cause physical injury. When we are physically hurt, people see our wounds and express sympathy. Cuts and bruises now have healed.
*   **Emotional Hurt:** Words cause emotional and mental pain. The suffering of emotional or mental pain cannot be seen by people, so we suffer alone.
*   **The Comparison:** Words are compared to **ghosts that haunt** us. This means the words come to the mind continually to create a disturbing effect, troubling our mind for a long period of time. The insult caused by words disturbs the mind for a long period of time, while body wounds heal fast.

#### Stanza 2: The Intensity of Word-Wounds
> *Slant and curved the word swords fall*
> *To pierce and stick inside me.*
> *Bats and bricks may ache through bones*
> *But words can mortify me.*

*   **The Comparison:** Words are called **‘swords’** in this stanza. Both swords and unkind words are sharp and hurt deeply.
*   **Effect:** The bitter words are described as **slant and curved**. They **pierce and stick inside**. This phrase means that the impact of bitter words is deep and long-lasting.
*   **Humiliation:** Harsh and bitter words can **mortify** us. Mortify means to make someone feel extremely embarrassed or ashamed.

#### Stanza 3: The Lasting Scar
> *Pain from words has left its scar*
> *On mind and heart that’s tender.*
> *Cuts and bruises now have healed;*
> *It’s words that I remember.*

*   **The Damage:** Both physical injury and harsh language leave scars. Physical injuries caused by weapons heal up.
*   **The Permanent Mark:** The pain from words leaves a **scar** (a permanent mark on the body due to a wound) on the **mind and heart that’s tender**. This scar is the reason the poet cannot forget the words; the pain caused by the words does not go away.
*   **Central Idea:** The pain caused by unpleasant words is much stronger and lasts longer than the physical injury caused by weapons. The emotional injury lasts long because words linger and haunt us, never allowing us to be at peace.

### Part 3: Literary Devices and Themes

#### 1. Literary Devices
The poet uses literary devices to create an impact and help readers infer the meaning.

| Device | Definition | Example in Poem (Inferred) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metaphor** | Compares two dissimilar things in terms of a shared quality. | Comparing **words with a sword** to show the intensity of pain. | |
| **Alliteration** | Repetition of initial sounds in words for emphasis and a musical effect. | Alliteration contributes to the sound effect. | |
| **Repetition** | Repeating words to emphasize important ideas. | The word **‘words’** is repeated six times to emphasize its importance and significance, as the effect of words is the focal point. | |

#### 2. The Significance of the Title ("The Truth")
The title is significant because while being truthful is important, if that truth is conveyed in ugly words, it leaves a scar on the heart and becomes painful. The poem reveals the harsh truth that emotional injury is far worse than physical injury.

#### 3. Guidance on Positive Communication
The lesson provides advice from M.K. Gandhi on controlling one's output of words:
*   "Keep your thoughts **Positive** because your Thoughts become your Words".
*   "Keep your words **Positive** because your Words become your Behavior".

#### 4. Importance of Forgiveness and Empathy
To maintain positive relationships, the lesson highlights positive qualities such as **empathy, sharing and caring, forgiveness, tolerance, and kindness**. When a relationship becomes unpleasant, suggested responses include showing empathy, being understanding of the reason for the other person’s behaviour, and communicating the desire to normalize relations.
