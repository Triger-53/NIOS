I would be happy to provide you with a full, detailed explanation of the lesson titled **"NEW GOOD THINGS FROM RUBBISH."** This lesson focuses on the critical need for recycling and conservation, addressing the environmental and economic benefits of controlling wasteful habits.

## Lesson 20: New Good Things From Rubbish

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

The central idea of this lesson is captured by the statement: **“We do not own the Earth, we hold it in trust for the future generations.”**. As the global population, consumption, and technology advance, people's needs increase, requiring more resources like paper, metal, and plastic. If new materials are made every time something is needed, it will lead to a **gradual decline of our natural resources**.

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Develop self-awareness regarding your actions concerning the wastage or conservation of Earth’s resources.
*   Suggest different methods of **recycling in everyday life**.
*   Recognize the importance of **preventing the wastage of Earth’s resources** and justify the need for recycling.
*   Identify words associated with natural resources.
*   Develop a dialogue and express your views on saving resources.
*   Identify and use **conjunctions (linking words)**.
*   Describe a **process using the passive voice**.

#### Core Theme: Reuse and Recycle
The lesson stresses that **waste materials will keep collecting, and our beautiful Earth will start to look like a garbage bin**. Therefore, it is important to control wasteful habits and understand that old items (metal, plastic utensils, books, newspapers) can either be **reused or recycled**.

*   **Reuse:** Using the same object over and over without changing its form.
*   **Recycle:** Transforming old or waste material into new, useful things.

Recycling not only helps **save money but also helps the environment** by lessening the pollution created by burning rubbish and saving valuable resources.

### Part 2: Recycling Specific Materials

The lesson discusses the feasibility and process of recycling four major waste materials: paper, plastic, metals, and glass.

#### 1. Paper
*   **Wastage:** Half the world’s waste consists of paper. For example, in the USA, about **75,000 trees are felled every week** just for printing the Sunday edition of the *New York Times*. Recycling used paper would easily save these trees.
*   **Process:** Many countries import waste paper rather than new pulp for their paper mills. The waste paper is **pulped, cleaned, and bleached** to remove most of the ink and dirt before it is turned into new paper. Japan, for instance, now makes half its paper by recycling.

#### 2. Plastic
*   **Difficulty:** Plastic is one of the **most difficult substances to recycle** because it comes in so many varieties. For example, some plastic bottles consist of six layers of different plastic types.
*   **Output Quality:** As yet, there is no simple way to turn an old plastic bottle into a new one. Plastic scrap can only be turned into a **product of lower quality**.
*   **Uses of Recycled Plastic:** Cleaned plastic might be cut into tiny pieces and used to stuff seat cushions, or a mixture of plastic waste can be recycled into plastic 'timber' for **durable fencing**. However, a lot of plastic waste still has to be thrown away.

#### 3. Metals
*   **Efficiency:** Metals are different from plastic. **Any car on the road today will consist, in part, of earlier cars** that have been scrapped and recycled into new steel.
*   **Profitability:** The more valuable the metal (like gold and silver), the more it pays to recycle it.
*   **Energy Savings:** Recycling aluminum is especially worthwhile because **extracting it from Bauxite consumes a huge amount of electricity**. Since the early 1970s, the energy used to make aluminum has fallen by a quarter because most of it is now recycled.

#### 4. Glass
*   **Best Method: Reuse:** The most sensible method for glass is to **use glass bottles as often as possible**. In countries still using milk bottles, the average bottle makes about **30 trips** to and from the dairy.
*   **Recycling Broken Glass:** Broken glass, known as **‘cullet’**, can also be recycled. Bottle banks are common in many western countries.
    *   **Colour Separation:** Glass is best separated by colour because cullet of mixed colours can only be used to make **green glass**.
*   **Recycling Success:** The success of bottle banks varies widely; the Swiss and Dutch recover 50 percent of their glass, while Britain only recovers 12 percent. In India, people sell their bottles, which are then reused.

### Part 3: Global Habits and Personal Action

#### Wasteful Habits
The lesson notes that Western countries waste a great deal of the Earth’s resources. While India generally avoids waste, as we enter the twenty-first century, we are **beginning to imitate some of the wasteful habits of Western countries** (such as using more disposable paper items for convenience). The text urges that this is something all of us need to think about and control.

#### Alternatives and Landfills
*   **Alternatives:** Suggestions to reduce waste include using cloth bags instead of paper bags and making furniture from steel or other material that can be easily recycled instead of wood.
*   **Landfills:** These are large areas used for waste disposal, where collected waste decomposes. Later, landfills can be used for various purposes, such as generating electricity (e.g., Puente Hills landfill, Los Angeles, USA, generates 50 MW) or building parks (e.g., Indraprastha Park, New Delhi, India).
*   **Composting:** Another method to manage biodegradable waste is home composting, where leftover food, peels, and leaves are converted into manure over five months.

### Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

#### 1. Conjunctions (Linking Words)
Conjunctions or linking words connect words or sentences. They are divided into two main categories:

*   **Coordinating Conjunctions (Category 1):** These join two words, phrases, or independent clauses (clauses that can stand alone). Examples include *and, but, yet, but still, even, as well as, either – or*.
    *   *Example:* Any car... will consist, in part, of earlier cars that have been scrapped **and** recycled.
*   **Subordinating Conjunctions (Category 2):** These link two sentences or clauses of unequal rank (linking a dependent clause to an independent clause). Examples include *when, where, though, because, since, if, until, till*.
    *   *Example:* Plastic is one of the most difficult substances to recycle **because** it comes in so many varieties.

The lesson also notes that words like *however* and *but* are used to introduce two contrasting ideas.

#### 2. Describing a Process (Passive Voice)
When describing a process (a series of steps taken to achieve a result), the **passive voice is often used**. This is because the actions themselves (the steps) are of the utmost importance, and the "agent or doer" is often not referred to.

*   Time markers like *first*, *second*, *next*, and *finally* are used to make the stages in the process explicit.
*   *Example (Paper recycling):* The waste is **pulped, cleaned and bleached**... before it is **turned** into new paper.
