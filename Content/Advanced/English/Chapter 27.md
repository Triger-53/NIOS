I would be happy to provide you with a full, detailed explanation of the lesson titled **"THE PARROT WHO WOULDN'T TALK,"** a humorous story written in the first person by the well-known author **Ruskin Bond**.

## Lesson 27: The Parrot Who Wouldn't Talk (Story by Ruskin Bond)

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

The story explores the relationship between a pet and its owner, highlighting the need for proper care, attention, love, and patience when dealing with animals.

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Read and enjoy a humorous (funny) story.
*   Relate to the feelings and recognize the needs of pets, and be kind to them.
*   Infer the role of **humour in conveying a message**.
*   Use modals and the present perfect continuous and past perfect continuous tenses.
*   Analyse a situation critically in order to make a decision.
*   Summarise a text and write a short paragraph describing a person.
*   Make requests, and give orders and instructions.
*   Identify rhyming words and enhance your vocabulary.

#### The Core Message
The message of this story is: **Be kind to your pets, and behave towards others as you would like them to behave towards you**. If training pets, one must use love and patience, and be **empathetic** towards them, recognizing that they depend on us and have feelings. Nobody likes **captivity** (being kept in a cage or locked space).

### Part 2: Part 1 — Aunt Ruby and the Captive

Part 1 introduces the antagonist (Aunt Ruby) and the unfortunate parakeet.

#### 1. The Setting and Acquisition
*   **Setting:** The story is set in the **pre-independence era** (probably 1944-45) in Granny’s bungalow in north India. In those days, many people, Indian and European, kept pet parrots, parakeets, or "lovebirds".
*   **The Bird:** Aunt Ruby bought a parakeet from a **bird-catcher** who sold various caged birds, including colourful budgerigars and little munnias.
    *   *Note:* A parakeet is a small parrot with predominantly green plumage and a long tail.
*   **Grandparents' View:** **Neither Granny nor Grandfather** were keen on keeping caged birds as pets because they felt the birds were **deprived of their freedom**.
*   **Aunt Ruby's Insistence:** Aunt Ruby insisted on keeping the parrot and teaching it to talk, threatening to throw a **dreadful tantrum** if she did not get her way.

#### 2. The Conflict
*   **The Parrot's Dislike:** The bird, kept in an **ornamental cage**, took an **instant dislike** to Aunt Ruby and resisted all her flattering statements or actions (**blandishments**).
*   **Failed Attempts:** Aunt Ruby would try to *coo* "Kiss, kiss!" by putting her face close to the bars. The parrot would **back away morosely** (gloomily), its beady little eyes getting smaller with anger at the prospect of being kissed.
*   **The Attack:** On one occasion, the parrot **lunged forward** (made a sudden forward movement) without warning and **knocked Aunt Ruby's spectacles off her nose**.
*   **Hostility:** After this, Aunt Ruby stopped her loving words (**endearments**) and became quite **hostile** (unfriendly) towards the "poor bird," making faces at it and calling out: **‘You are no beauty! Can’t talk, can’t sing, can’t dance!’**. These unkind words emphasize what the bird cannot do.

### Part 3: Part 2 — The Escape and the Final Word

The narrator (Aunt Ruby’s nephew), who was ten years old, takes over the care of the parrot after Aunt Ruby becomes hostile.

#### 1. Empathy and Freedom
*   **The Bond:** A **tender relationship** develops between the author and the parrot. The boy fed the parrot things it liked, such as **green chillies and ripe tomatoes**, supplemented by slices of mango.
*   **The Escape:** One afternoon, while everyone was enjoying a **siesta** (an early afternoon nap) indoors, the boy **deliberately left the cage door open**. The bird immediately flew away quickly (**winging its way**) to the mango orchard, achieving its freedom.
*   **Grandfather's View:** Grandfather, who did not approve of caging birds, simply shrugged when told the door was loose, and remarked: **“Well, neither did your bird,”** when Aunt Ruby protested that goldfish (offered as a replacement) don’t talk.

#### 2. The Return and the Lesson
*   **The Return:** The author thought they would never see the parrot again, but a few days later, it returned, sitting on the veranda railing and looking **expectantly** (eagerly or hopefully) at the boy. The author unselfishly shared half of his mango with the bird.
*   **Aunt Ruby’s Claim:** When Aunt Ruby emerged, she cried out, **“Look, it’s my parrot come back! He must have missed me!”**.
*   **The Final Squawk:** With a loud **squawk** (a loud, harsh sound), the parrot flew out of her reach, perched on a rose bush, and shrieked in Aunt Ruby’s familiar tones: **‘You’re no beauty! Can’t talk, can’t sing, can’t dance!’**.
*   **The Irony:** Aunt Ruby was deeply embarrassed ("went ruby-red and dashed indoors"). The humour lies in the fact that the parrot had learned to talk after all, but used the very words Aunt Ruby had used to humiliate it when it was in captivity. The parrot became a frequent visitor, repeating the taunt whenever it saw her.

### Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

The lesson provides detailed instruction on several grammar and writing topics.

#### 1. Modals
Modals are special verbs used with the main verb to express possibility, necessity, requests, ability, duty, or intention.
*   *Examples:* *May* I borrow your notebook? (seeking permission); You *must* take better care of your health (necessity); We *ought to* respect our parents (moral obligation).
*   *Rules:* Modals do not take '-s' in the third person singular, have no '-ing' or '-ed' forms, and are always used with a main verb.

#### 2. Perfect Continuous Tenses
*   **Present Perfect Continuous Tense:** Used for an action that began in the past and is **still continuing**, or an action that has taken place but whose **effect is still there** (Structure: has/have + been + verb + -ing).
    *   *Example:* He is dirty because he **has been playing** in the garden.
*   **Past Perfect Continuous Tense:** Used for an action that **began before a point in the past** and continued up to that time (Structure: had + been + verb + -ing).
    *   *Example:* We **had been watching** television when the lights went off.

#### 3. Requests, Orders, and Instructions
*   **Requests:** Asking someone for something or to do something, often using modals like *can, could, will,* or *would*. Using *couldn’t* or introductory phrases like *I wonder* or *Could you possibly* makes the request more polite.
    *   *Example:* *Could you possibly* clean the table?.
*   **Orders:** Telling someone to do something (e.g., *Be quiet!*), often used when you have authority. Adding *please* makes the order more polite.
*   **Instructions:** Telling someone **how** to do something or **what** to do in a particular situation (e.g., directions or recipe steps).

#### 4. Vocabulary and Literary Terms
*   **Prefix 'dis-':** Means 'not' or the 'opposite of' (e.g., dis + like = **dislike**).
*   **Phrases with 'wing':** Include *winging its way* (flying away quickly), *take wing* (to depart quickly), *under one’s wing* (under protection), and *spread one’s wings* (to start new activities/be independent).
*   **Bird Sounds:** Different birds make different sounds, such as a pigeon’s *coo*, a duck’s *quack*, a crow’s *caw*, and a parrot’s *squawk* or *chatter*.

#### 5. Writing Skills
The lesson teaches how to write a **short paragraph describing a person** (focusing on height, build, hair, eyes, facial features, clothes, and personality), and how to **summarise a text** by focusing on the main theme, key words, and facts, while avoiding personal opinions.
