## Lesson 16: My Only Cry (Poem by Leila Ibrahim Semaan)

### Part 1: Objectives and Context

The lesson is based on the grave reality that the world has become a "storePoem by Leila Ibrahim Semaan)

### Part 1: Objectives and Context

The lesson is based on the grave reality that the world has become a "store house of very dangerous weapons" since the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. This destructive arms race is driven by countries seeking to become more powerful and protect themselves from others.

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   State the **theme of the poem**.
*   Relate to the poet’s fears and **apprehensions about weapons**.
*   Identify the difference between **blank verse and rhyming verse**.
*   Express your **protest** against an issue.
*   Use **adverbial antonyms**.

#### The Theme: The Cry Against Destruction
The poem focuses on the dire consequences of developing destructive weapons. The adults disregard their responsibility to save the world and keep it secure for the future. The central message is that adults must stop making weapons and war and make the world a happy, safe, and peaceful place for children.

### Part 2: Understanding the Poem (The Child’s Voice)

The poem is presented as a touching appeal for peace by a child speaking for all the children of the world.

#### 1. The Accusation and the Lie (Part 1)
The child begins by addressing the "grown-ups" directly.

*   **Deception:** The child asks, "Who are you deceiving?". The child asserts, "I don’t know how to lie like you". The child knows the truth, but the adults hide it with their lies.
*   **The Lies:** The lies are typically assurances that the world is safe, and arms will not be used, but the child recognizes this as deceit. The adults think they are deceiving children, but they are actually deceiving themselves.
*   **Helplessness:** The child cries that children alone "Could not rebuild what you destroy". The problem is that only the adults can build a better world, but they are the ones destroying it.
*   **The Deaf World:** The child finds that their cries are "useless, in a deaf world". The world is called "deaf" because it does not hear the children's desperate pleas.

#### 2. The Demand for Action (Part 2)
The child quickly tires of meaningless talk and promises.

*   **Empty Words:** The child states that words like **Peace and fellowship** (friendship/companionship) should be spoken by adults. The child feels it does not make much difference when children speak of these concepts.
*   **Stop Waiting:** The child is "tired of waiting for the adults to keep their promises" and urges: **"Enough promises. Enough waiting"**.
*   **The Protest:** The child calls upon everyone (children and adults) to join the protest. The child asks them to stop three things:
    1.  Stop making arms.
    2.  Stop making wars break out.
    3.  Stop telling lies.
*   **The Essential Cry:** The children, speaking "in your name" (the name of the adults who feel the same way), issue their only demand: **“Close your arms factories and think about taming the winds”**.
    *   **Taming the winds** means controlling the destructive ideas of countries and people and using that energy for the welfare of mankind.

#### 3. Political Disregard and Affection
The child separates children’s essential needs from adult political conflict.

*   **Politics and Division:** The child asserts that **Right-wing politics** (promoting rigid social order) and **Left-wing politics** (promoting rights of the underprivileged) matter little to them. The poet suggests that politics divides people, creates hatred, and leads to wars and destruction.
*   **Children’s Essential Need:** The life of a child is **essentially (fundamentally) affection**.
*   **The Threat:** However, through the **fault of the adults**, "a veil of dust lies over it". This means the children's lives are under the threat of weapons and destruction [25, 30(c)].

### Part 3: Literary Analysis (Blank Verse and Pronoun Use)

The poem uses specific structural elements to convey its urgent message.

#### 1. Blank Verse
The poem does **not have the usual rhyme and jingle**. The lines do not end in similar sounds; therefore, the poem is written in **blank verse**.
*   **Characteristics of Blank Verse:** It consists of unrhymed lines but has a singular pattern of movement and a regular rhythm.
*   **Freedom:** In blank verse, the poet has the freedom to vary the number and length of lines according to the thought of the poem. The number of lines and length of lines in the stanzas of "My Only Cry" varies.

#### 2. Shifting Pronouns
The poet uses pronouns (*I, you, we, our, them, your, us*) extensively, with continuous shifts in reference points.

*   **Purpose of Shifting:** This technique makes the reader "feel the presence of other characters in the poem". When the child uses pronouns like *You* for other children, adults, and arm makers, it feels as if the child is **turning and talking to each of them**.

### Part 4: Grammar Focus (Adverbs and Antonyms)

The lesson focuses on adverbs and their opposites.

#### 1. Adverbs
An adverb is used to describe a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.
*   **Examples from the text:** *Listen, listen **carefully**; Life is **essentially** affection*.
*   **Form:** Adverbs generally end in ‘-ly’ (like *carefully*), but not all words ending in ‘-ly’ are adverbs (e.g., *lonely* and *friendly* are adjectives).

#### 2. Adverbial Antonyms
Like other words, adverbs also have antonyms, known as **adverbial antonyms**.
*   *Example:* The antonym of the adverb *carefully* is **carelessly**.

### Part 5: Historical Context and Appeal

The lesson provides specific information about the danger posed by nuclear weapons:

*   **Nuclear Club:** The nations possessing nuclear weapons are referred to as the Nuclear Club (USA, Russia, UK, France, and China). India, Pakistan, and North Korea have conducted nuclear tests.
*   **Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT):** This treaty, signed in 1970 and currently signed by 189 nations, dictates that nations must not transfer nuclear devices, must not use nuclear weapons except in response to an attack, and must use nuclear technology only for **peaceful purposes**.
*   **The Hiroshima Memorial:** The lesson uses the poignant story of **Sadako Sasaki** and the statue in the Peace Park of Hiroshima ("This is our cry. This is our prayer. Peace on Earth") to reinforce the poem's theme of juvenile suffering due to the destructive acts of adults.
