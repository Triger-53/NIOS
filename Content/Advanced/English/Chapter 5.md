This detailed lesson covers the story **"A Tiger Comes to Town-I,"** which is unusual because it is told entirely from the **viewpoint of the tiger** itself. The story follows a runaway circus tiger and explores themes of human fear, animal feelings, and arrogance.

## Part 1: Objectives and Context

### 1. The Story’s Foundation
The tiger is the central character of this story, which is divided into two parts. The tiger had been trained by its master to perform tricks for large audiences at a circus.

### 2. Key Learning Objectives
By studying Part I of this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Read and enjoy an interesting story told from a tiger’s perspective.
*   Follow the **sequence of events** as they happen.
*   Relate to animals with **compassion** and develop the awareness that animals have feelings.
*   Infer the meaning of new words from context and identify literary expressions (like similes).
*   Learn grammar concepts such as converting imperative sentences into indirect speech and using the past perfect tense.

### 3. The Tiger's Misconception
The tiger initially believed that human beings were **strong and fearless** because, at the circus, they sat peacefully while he "cowered before captain’s whip". He admits he got a "totally wrong idea of human beings at that angle" (from his viewpoint in the performing ring). The tiger got the chance to go out into the town because he found his enclosure unguarded and open.

## Part 2: The Tiger's Walk and Human Panic

As the tiger walks through the town, he is confused and amused by the human reaction, which contradicts his previous belief about their bravery.

### 1. Widespread Panic
*   When the tiger entered Market Road, people ran for their lives.
*   **The population was melting out of sight** (disappearing) as people pulled down shutters and hid in drains, on trees, and behind pillars.
*   The tiger observed people running from him **like a herd of deer**, even though he had "no intention of attacking them".
*   The townspeople were seized by sheer hopelessness and withdrew into their homes, shutting, bolting, and sealing doors and windows. Some even thought the tiger was an **extraordinary creature** who might pass through walls or lie in wait on the roof or in the basement.

### 2. Specific Incidents of Flight
*   **The Tailor:** When the tiger paused in front of a tailor’s shop, the tailor abandoned his machine, shut himself in a cupboard, and began wailing, “Alas, I am undone, won’t someone shoot that tiger?”.
*   **The Prisoner:** A prisoner being escorted by two constables got a chance to escape when the constables fled, abandoning him with his handcuffs.
*   **The Horse Carriage:** The tiger tore a horse from its *Jutka* (carriage), enjoying the sight of the passengers "spilling out" and running for their lives.

### 3. The Restaurant Pause
The tiger rested at the door of a restaurant. The people inside (coffee drinkers and tiffin-eaters) sat still, uttering low moans.

*   **The Tiger’s Thoughts:** He wanted to assure them he was not out to trouble them, stating, **“I’m not out to kill. I’m too full.”**.
*   **The Food Source:** He explained that he had found a "green pasture full of food" on his way and would not need food for several days.
*   **A Critique of Humanity:** The tiger contrasted his predatory nature with human actions: "Tigers attack only when they feel hungry, **unlike human beings who kill one another without purpose or hunger**".
*   **His Size:** He also explained his massive size—eleven feet tip to tail—as the reason why his tail was trailing down to the street and blocking the threshold.

### 4. The School and the Capture
To the great delight of children, schools were hurriedly closed. The children ran **helter-skelter** (here and there in fear), screaming joyously, excited to see the tiger.

*   **The Headmaster's Panic:** The tiger entered the Headmaster’s room. He saw the "dignified man" jump onto his table and **heave** (pull/lift) himself up into an attic (a room at the top of a building).
*   **Sleep and Capture:** The tiger, liking cool stone floors, flung himself down under the large desk to sleep. While he slept, he was locked up and watched.

## Part 3: The Master’s Philosophy

After the tiger woke up, his Master arrived and pushed his way through the crowd.

### 1. A Word of Scolding
The tiger heard a teacher refer to him as a "brute". The Master angrily scolded the teacher, stating: **“Never use the words ‘beast’ or ‘brute’. They’re ugly words coined by man in his arrogance**. The Master believed the human being thinks all other creatures are "beasts" out of a sense of self-importance or superiority. This response shows the Master was kind and understood his animals well.

### 2. The Profound Question
When one of the upset teachers asked the Master, "Who are you?", the Master retorted (shouted back quickly) with a serious and deep reply:

> **“You are asking a profound question. I’ve no idea who I am! All my life I have been trying to find the answer. Are you sure you know who you are?”**

The Master thought this was a question with a deep meaning that could not be answered casually.

## Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

### 1. Past Perfect Tense (Grammar)
This tense is used to describe an action that was **completed in the past, before another action also in the past**. It is formed using **had + the third form** of the action word.
*   *Example:* *At the circus I had no chance to study human beings* (The lack of chance occurred before the current event).
*   *Example:* *I had thought that they were strong and fearless* (The thinking occurred before the realization).

### 2. Imperative Sentences and Indirect Speech (Grammar)
An imperative sentence expresses a **command, request, instruction, advice, or suggestion**.
When changing these to indirect (Reported) speech, the reporting verb (like *said* or *told*) is replaced by a verb that conveys the correct tone.
*   **Commands:** *ordered, instructed, told*.
*   **Requests:** *begged, requested, pleaded, asked, told*.
*   **Advice:** *advised, recommended, urged*.
*   **Suggestions:** *suggested, recommended, proposed*.

### 3. Similes (Literary Device)
Similes are expressions used for **comparing two different things** using the words **‘as’ or ‘like’**.
*   *Example from the text:* Running **like a herd of deer**.
*   *Other examples:* as black as coal; strong like a lion.

### 4. Sequence Markers (Writing)
The lesson emphasizes that when writing a story or narrating an event, you should use sequence markers to link actions and ensure the story flows logically.
*   *Examples:* *after*, *then*, *later*, *by then*, *as soon as*.
