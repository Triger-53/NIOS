## Lesson 13: The Last Stone Mason

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

This lesson uses the story of an old sculptor and his son to explore critical questions facing traditional artisans in the modern world.

#### 1. The Theme: The Dying Art of Traditional Craft
The lesson highlights that traditional arts and crafts, which are an important part of our culture and heritage, are **dying out**.

*   **Reasons for Decline:** The traditional handicrafts trade often does not **fetch much money**. Artisans struggle hard to make ends meet. There isn't much demand for their handmade products.
*   **The Young Generation's Conflict:** Young artisans are leaving their family handicraft industry because they want to earn more money quickly. They favour the **mass production** of items that can be produced quickly rather than by hand.
*   **Core Question:** The story asks if we should let our traditional arts and crafts die out and what should be done to solve the problems faced by young artisans.

#### 2. Key Objectives
The lesson aims to help you analyze the character of the father, explain the importance of cooperation and effective communication in a family, and deduce that the **urge to learn helps in mastering a skill**.

### Part 2: The Conflict of Art vs. Money (Part 1)

The story begins with the bitter confrontation between the old sculptor (Masterjee) and his son, Gopal.

#### 1. The Son's Departure
The young man (Gopal) throws the hammer and chisel to the ground. He angrily announces, **"I'm leaving you, father, I’m leaving you and your work"**.

*   **Gopal’s Justification:** He looks around their small, congested dark room, stacked with stone slabs and used clothes, and cries that this work has brought them "**nothing, nothing!**". He states this kind of work "just doesn’t pay".
*   **Gopal’s Suggestion:** He argues that times have changed, and the old man cannot live carving only sculptures for temples. Gopal wants his father to adopt mass production, like others in Agra, making commercial items such as candle stands, paper-weights, ashtrays, and plates for tourists, because there is **"so much more money"** in those items.

#### 2. The Father's Commitment to Tradition
The old man is a sculptor who loves his art and is totally **committed** to it, despite financial difficulties.

*   **The Value of Service:** The old man, though trembling, gently replies, "It is not the money alone that matters, son. It is the service, our **service to God**". He believes making statues of gods and goddesses is like worshipping God.
*   **The Family Tradition:** He defends his method, stating he learned this work from his father, who learned it from his own father, keeping the tradition for **hundreds of years**. He hoped Gopal would continue their work.

Gopal walks out angrily, saying goodbye hesitantly, but the old man, closing his eyes in prayer before the half-finished marble statues of Radha and Krishna, does not seem to listen.

### Part 3: The Struggle and the Revelation (Parts 2 & 3)

After Gopal leaves, the old man, tired and emotionally stressed, vows to complete the statue himself.

#### 1. Salim's Support
*   **The Helper:** Salim, the servant boy (who is orphaned), enters the workshop with a cup of tea, his voice **"filled with concern"** for the old man’s health.
*   **The Burden:** The old man tells Salim he will soon be the **"last stone mason here"**. He worries about finishing the work all by himself, noting he has "very little strength" and carving takes too long.
*   **Dedication:** The old man picks up the chisel and hammer, loving his work and refusing to change it. He works continuously for days without rest. His desire is to finish this sculpture, which he feels will be his last. He works until he is completely exhausted, his hands trembling, and his eyes failing.

#### 2. The Nature of True Art
When the old man finally collapses, he laments that he cannot finish the work. He admits that Gopal was "not a good sculptor" and lacked the ability to carve the face and hands properly.

*   **Inner Talent:** He states that the "something missing" in Gopal’s fingers **"can’t be taught"**. Salim whispers, "Because it comes from somewhere **deep inside you**". The old man agrees, emphasizing that if that talent isn't inside you, you are better off going to Agra for mass production.
*   **Collapse:** The old man works till late, praying for strength and his son. In the early hours of the morning, the chisel and hammer fall, and he faints.

#### 3. The Stunned Discovery
*   **The Sound:** The old man wakes up on his cot and hears the distinct sound of a "strong blow of the hammer on the top of a chisel" from the workshop.
*   **The Hope:** He immediately thinks, "**Gopal! He was back**," and, though weak, walks to the door, intending to finish the statue together.
*   **The Truth:** The words freeze on his lips as he sees the young carver: **it is not Gopal, but Salim**, working skillfully on the face of the statue. The old man is **stunned** and unable to speak.
*   **Salim’s Confession:** Salim explains, "I…I….only want to help" and confesses he has been **practicing secretly in the quarry for almost two years**.
*   **The Recognition:** Anger gives way to admiration. The old man recognizes Salim's talent and will to work hard. He pulls the boy's head to his shoulder and whispers, "**There is nothing I can teach you, my son. Go ahead, you have it in your heart**". He believes Salim "will be one of the best stone masons India will ever have".

### Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

#### 1. Present Perfect Tense
This tense is used to describe an action that has been completed **very recently**. It is constructed using **has/have + the past participle** of the verb.

*   *Examples:* "Look what it **has brought** us!"; "We **have kept up** the tradition"; "He **has travelled** all over India" (negative uses *not/never*).

#### 2. Non-Finites (The function of '-ing' words)
Words ending in '-ing' are classified based on their function in a sentence:

*   **Finite Verb:** When it is the main verb of a progressive tense (e.g., *The children are **swimming***).
*   **Non-Finite Verb:** When it acts as:
    *   **A Subject:** ***Swimming** is a very good exercise*.
    *   **An Object:** *He enjoys **swimming***.
    *   **A Describing Word:** *The **swimming** pool*.

#### 3. Adverbs of Manner
These are words that show **how** an action happened or how it was performed. They often modify the verb.

*   *Examples from the text:* He heard **correctly**; **Weakly** he walked to the door; I have been practising **secretly**.

#### 4. Vocabulary (Professions)
The lesson teaches word building by defining professions based on their specific work:

*   A person who treats patients is a **doctor**.
*   A person who writes poems is a **poet**.
*   A person who makes wooden furniture is a **carpenter**.
*   A person whose job is to weave cloth or carpets is a **weaver**.
