## Part 2: The Story of the Bridge and the Blessing

### The Task (The Dignity of Labour)

Lord Rama asked his army to build a stone bridge over the sea. The work was described as very difficult and took a long time.

*   **The Monkey Army’s Work:** Thousands of monkeys worked night and day. They pulled out rocks and heavy stones from the mountains, carried them to the sea, and cut them into shape for the construction. Rama was happy, realizing their effort stemmed from their love for him.

### The Smallest Contributor

One day, Rama noticed a small brown squirrel.

*   **The Squirrel’s Action:** The little squirrel was going up and down the seashore, carrying only **little pebbles** at a time in its small mouth and dropping them into the sea. The squirrel’s heart cried out for Rama, and he wanted to do all he could for him.

### The Conflict and Mockery

The squirrel’s dedication was met with scorn and rudeness from the large monkeys.

1.  **The Confrontation:** A great monkey, carrying a large heavy stone, nearly fell when the squirrel came in his way.
2.  **The Monkey’s Reaction:** The monkey shouted at the squirrel in a voice like thunder and demanded to know what it was doing.
3.  **The Squirrel’s Response:** The little squirrel replied in his small voice, apologizing for being in the way and politely stating, “I’m helping Rama build the bridge”.
4.  **The Insult:** The monkey shouted and laughed aloud, calling the squirrel’s effort a "funny story". The monkeys mocked him, saying that pebbles couldn't build a bridge and telling him to go home.
5.  **The Violence:** Because the squirrel refused to stop helping, the angry monkeys picked him up by his tail and threw (flung) him far away.

### Lord Rama’s Intervention

1.  **The Rescue:** Crying out Rama’s name, the squirrel fell directly into Lord Rama’s hands.
2.  **The Lesson for the Army:** Rama held the squirrel close and immediately addressed the monkeys, instructing them, **“Do not make fun of the weak and the small. Your strength or what you do is not important. What matters is your love”**.
3.  **The Gift (The Stripes):** Rama then held the squirrel closer and said, “Little one, your love touches my heart.” He passed his fingers gently over the squirrel’s back. When he put the squirrel down, there were **three white stripes** on his back. These stripes are believed to be the marks of Lord Rama’s fingers, which squirrels carry from then on.

### Contrast of Characters
The story provides a clear contrast between the main characters:

| Feature | Monkey | Squirrel |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | Great / Big | Small / Little |
| **Voice** | Loud (like thunder) | Small / Weak / Soft |
| **Strength** | Strong | Weak |
| **Attitude** | Rude / Impolite | Polite |

## Part 3: Language Focus

### 1. Adjectives and Sequencing

Adjectives are words used to describe a person, place, or thing, often conveying details like size, colour, age, or origin.

When two or more adjectives are used before a noun, they usually follow a specific order.

*   **Rule for Numbers:** Numbers always go before other adjectives.
    *   *Example:* **three** white stripes.
*   **Rule for Commas:** If you use more than two adjectives, you typically separate them with a comma.
*   **Examples from the text:** *a **small brown** squirrel*, *a **large heavy** stone*.

### 2. Identifying and Stopping Bullying

The lesson includes a note on bullying, which connects directly to the monkeys' behaviour toward the squirrel.

*   **Definition:** Bullying is defined as intentionally hurting someone in physical, verbal, or psychological ways.
*   **Actions:** It can include name-calling, threats, mocking, hitting, or pushing.
*   **Impact:** When teasing becomes hurtful, unkind, and constant, it is bullying and must be stopped, as the effects can seriously affect the victim’s sense of self-worth.

### 3. Describing an Object

A practical skill taught in the lesson is how to provide a detailed description of an object, often for a "Lost" notice. Key details you must include are:

*   Brand name (e.g., Titan Classique)
*   Size & shape (e.g., small, diamond-shaped)
*   Colour (e.g., golden dial, black strap)
*   Features (e.g., water-resistant)
