## Part 1: The Story of Raja and the Misunderstanding

The core of this lesson is a story about a young boy, Raja, who is described as innocent and adventurous. His habit of meddling with creatures like snakes and bees causes concern for his grandparents.

### Raja and the Snake (Part 1 Summary)

1.  **The Incident:** One day, Raja saw a small snake crawling in the compound. When the snake saw Raja, it quickly moved away and hid inside a coconut shell.
2.  **Raja’s Action:** Raja quietly went near the shell, closed the mouth of the coconut shell with a stone, and ran excitedly to his Grandmother, declaring, **"Look, Grandma... I have caught a snake"**.
3.  **The Grandparents’ Reaction:** Grandmother was shocked and cried out for help. Grandfather came running, snatched the shell, and threw it away. The snake crawled away. Grandfather warned Raja that snakes are very dangerous and he should never go near one. The grandparents were worried about Raja’s safety.

### The Bee Sting (Part 2 Summary)

1.  **A New Incident:** Later that evening, Raja tried to catch a bee. The bee stung him on his finger, causing a sharp pain.
2.  **The Misdiagnosis:** Raja ran to his Grandmother and said he had been "bitten" and needed the pain stopped. Since Raja had been involved with a snake earlier that day, his Grandmother immediately thought he had been bitten by a snake.
3.  **Panic:** Grandfather came at once, saw a blue mark on Raja’s finger, and without saying anything, took Raja in his arms and began running. He ran a long distance across the garden and through the paddy fields until he reached a small, distant house.
4.  **Raja’s Silence:** Raja wanted to tell his grandparents that it was only a bee that had stung him, but Grandfather held him tight and would not allow him to talk. Grandmother and other people arrived, looking sad and silently watching Raja.

### The Medicine Man (Part 3 Summary and Conclusion)

1.  **The Untrained Healer:** Grandfather shouted for the old, grey-haired man who lived there, believing this man "knew the cure for snake bite".
2.  **The Ritual:** The old man took Raja inside, asked him to sit, took water in a small brass vessel, and started reciting *mantras*. Raja sat on his Grandfather's lap.
3.  **The Deception:** By this time, the pain in Raja's finger had already stopped. After a few minutes, the old man washed Raja’s finger and gave him water to drink. He then told Grandfather, **"Thank God, you brought Raja in time. He is out of danger now. It was indeed a poisonous snake that bit him"**.
4.  **The Aftermath:** Grandfather, Grandmother, and the others thanked the old man for the "magic cure," and Grandfather later sent him gifts. Raja knew the old man did not cure him, as the pain had already stopped; he realized the old man was a liar who had fooled everybody.

## Key Learning Concepts and Themes

The lesson uses Raja’s experience to highlight several important themes:

### 1. Superstition and Blind Faith
The story critiques **superstitions and blind faith in untrained medicine men**. Raja’s grandparents were convinced the medicine man cured a serious snake bite. Raja, however, realized that the old man was a deceiver who capitalized on their fear and lack of knowledge. The lesson advises that we should "beware of untrained medicine men (like the old man in the story) who cheat innocent people by creating fear in their minds".

### 2. Communication and Action
It is crucial to find out what truly happened in an emergency before reacting, otherwise, we risk making mistakes and unnecessarily complicating simple situations.
The lesson emphasizes the importance of **timely and effective communication** and realizing that **silence is not always good**. Raja’s silence, forced by his Grandfather holding him tight, allowed the misunderstanding to continue.

### 3. Understanding Animals
The lesson encourages relating to the feelings and behaviour of reptiles and other living creatures. It challenges the common **myth that all snakes are dangerous**.

**Did You Know? (Facts about Snakes and Bees)**

*   **Snakes:** There are about 2000 species of snakes in the world, and **not all snakes are poisonous**. In India, only about 70 of the 270 species are poisonous. Some well-known Indian species include the cobra, krait, python, and Russell’s viper.
*   **Bees:** Bees only sting in self-defence. A bee dies instantly after stinging. If stung, one should remove the stinger quickly, and an ice pack can help reduce swelling and pain.

## Language Focus: Grammar and Vocabulary

The lesson also provides instruction on using language effectively:

### 1. Making Requests

When asking someone to do something or asking for permission, it is important to sound polite.

*   **Requesting action:** *“Could you shut the door for me, please?”* or *“Would you mind passing the paper, please?”*.
*   **Asking permission:** *“Can I use your computer, please?”* or *“Do you mind if I turn on the fan?”*.

### 2. The Verb (Regular and Irregular)

Verbs are classified based on how they form the simple past tense.

*   **Regular Verbs:** These form the simple past tense by adding ‘-d’ or ‘-ed’ to the present tense form.
    *   *Examples:* shock $\to$ **shocked**, call $\to$ **called**, live $\to$ **lived**.
*   **Irregular Verbs:** These verbs do not follow the ‘-d’ or ‘-ed’ rule and involve a change in spelling.
    *   *Examples:* take $\to$ **took**, throw $\to$ **threw**, catch $\to$ **caught**, run $\to$ **ran**.
    *   *Note:* Some irregular verbs remain the same in both the present and past tense (e.g., *put*).

### 3. Adverbs

Adverbs are words that tell us something more about a verb (the action word). They often tell us *how* an action is done.

*   **Formation:** Usually, adverbs are formed by adding ‘-ly’ to adjectives.
    *   *Examples:* loud $\to$ **loudly**, slow $\to$ **slowly**, beautiful $\to$ **beautifully**.
*   **Exceptions:** Some adjectives, like *fast*, are used as adverbs without adding ‘-ly’ (e.g., "I walk **fast**").
