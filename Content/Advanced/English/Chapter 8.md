####  1: Objectives and Context

This lesson emphasizes the power of communication, leadership, and moral courage, particularly during a time of national struggle.

#### 1. The Power of a Letter
The lesson opens by noting that while gifts bring happiness and love, a **letter of blessing is often more valuable than a material gift**. Since Nehru was in prison, he could only send a letter.

#### 2. Key Objectives

*   Recognize the value of a letter as a powerful means of communication.

### Part 2: The Contents of the Letter

Nehru uses the letter not just to convey good wishes, but to offer guidance on developing moral character.

#### 1. The Gift of Mind and Spirit
Nehru notes that Indira is used to receiving presents and good wishes on her birthday. While he sends her good wishes "in full measure," he cannot send a material or solid present from prison.
*   **His True Gift:** His gift must be "of the **mind and spirit**," things that "even the high walls of prison cannot stop".

#### 2. Dislike of Sermonising
Nehru expresses his dislike for **sermonising** (giving a lecture) and **doling out** (giving) good advice.
*   **Preferred Method:** He believes the best way to find out what is right and wrong is not by giving a sermon, but **by talking and discussing**. He hopes that "out of discussion sometimes a little bit of truth comes out".
*   **The Letter's Limitation:** Nehru acknowledges that a letter is a "one-sided affair" and can hardly take the place of a talk. He asks her to "Imagine that I have made a suggestion to you for you to think over, as if we really were having a talk".

#### 3. Heroes and the Freedom Movement (Part 2 Focus)
Nehru draws on history to inspire Indira.
*   **The Inspiration:** He asks if she remembers being "fascinated" by the story of **Jeanne d’Arc** and wishing to be like her.
*   **Ordinary People:** Ordinary men and women usually focus on their "bread and butter" and "household worries". However, a time comes when a "whole people become interested in a **great cause**".
*   **The Power of Leadership:** Great leaders inspire people to do great deeds, helping ordinary men and women to become heroes.
*   **Bapuji's Magic:** Nehru refers to **Mahatma Gandhi (Bapuji)** as a great leader "full of love for all who suffer and eager to help them". Although Bapuji is in prison, "the **magic of his message** has stolen the hearts of India’s millions".
*   **The "Great Drama":** Men, women, and even children are coming out of their "little shells" to become "India’s soldiers of freedom". The "great drama" refers to the massive participation in the fight for freedom. Nehru notes that they are fortunate to be seeing and participating in this history being made.

#### 4. The Test of Right and Wrong (Part 3 Focus)
Nehru advises Indira on how to choose the right path and develop soldier-like qualities.
*   **Respecting India's Honour:** If they are to be India’s soldiers, they must respect India’s honour, which is a **sacred trust**.
*   **The Simple Test:** Whenever she is in doubt about what is right, she should apply one "little test": **"Never do anything in secret or anything that you would wish to hide"**.
*   **Fear is Unworthy:** The desire to hide something means one is afraid, and "fear is a bad thing and **unworthy** of you".
*   **Be Brave:** Nehru encourages her: **"Be brave, and all the rest follows"**.
*   **Working in the Light:** Under Bapuji’s leadership, the Freedom Movement has no room for secrecy or hiding. They are not afraid of what they do or say and "work in the sun and in the light". He advises Indira to live her private life the same way: **"make friends with the sun and work in the light and do nothing secretly"**. This will make her grow up "a child of the light, unafraid and serene and unruffled".

### Part 3: Language and Grammar Focus

The lesson uses the letter to teach specific language skills.

#### 1. Homophones
Homophones are words that sound similar but have different spellings and meanings.

| Sound-Alike Pair | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| Break / Brake | *Brake* (car mechanism); *Break* (to shatter) |
| Cheque / Check | *Cheque* (bank payment); *Check* (to inspect) |
| Dear / Deer | *Dear* (loved one); *Deer* (animal) |
| Fair / Fare | *Fair* (just/light); *Fare* (travel cost) |
| Heal / Heel | *Heal* (to cure); *Heel* (part of foot) |
| Right / Write | *Right* (correct); *Write* (to record text) |
| Lose / Loose | *Lose* (to misplace); *Loose* (not tight) |
| Peace / Piece | *Peace* (non-violence/calm); *Piece* (a part/slice) |

#### 2. Constructing ‘Wh’ Questions (Interrogative Sentences)
'Wh' questions begin with words like *when, what, where, why, who, whom, whose, which,* and *how*. They require a detailed answer, unlike Yes/No questions.
*   **Examples from the text:** "What present can I send you from Naini Prison?".

#### 3. Imperative Sentences
Imperative sentences are used for **giving instructions, commands, advice, or requests**. The main characteristic is that the verb usually comes before the subject (which is often understood to be 'you').

*   **Positive Imperatives (Commands/Requests):** *Obey your elders*; *Put off the lights*.
*   **Negative Imperatives:** These begin with 'Don’t' or 'Never'. *Don’t tell a lie*; *Never fear*.
