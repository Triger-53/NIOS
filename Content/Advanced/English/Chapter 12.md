I will now provide you with a full, detailed explanation of the lesson titled **"INDIAN WEAVERS,"** a famous poem by Sarojini Naidu, who was known as **Bharatiya Kokila (The Nightingale of India)**.

This lesson uses the metaphor of weaving at different times of the day to symbolize the three main stages of human life: birth, youth (marriage), and death.

### Part 2: Understanding the Poem (Stanza by Stanza)

The poem is structured as a series of three questions asked by the poet (one voice) and three answers given by the weavers (the other voice). Each stanza represents a different time of day, a different garment, and a different stage of life.

#### Stanza I: Birth (Break of Day)

> *Weavers, weaving at break of day,*
> *Why do you weave a garment so gay?*
> *Blue as the wing of halcyon wild*
> *We weave the robes of a new-born child.*

*   **Time of Day:** **Break of day** (early morning).
*   **Mood:** The mood is one of **cheerfulness**. The word ‘gay’ means bright.
*   **Garment and Stage of Life:** The weavers are weaving **robes (clothes)** for a **new-born child**. This time of day symbolizes **birth/childhood** because morning is the beginning of the day, just as birth is the beginning of life.
*   **Colour and Comparison:** The garment is a beautiful **blue**. This colour is compared to the **wing of the halcyon wild**. The "Halcyon" is a mythological bird associated with the kingfisher.

#### Stanza II: Youth and Marriage (Fall of Night)

> *Weavers, weaving at fall of night,*
> *Why do you weave a garment so bright?*
> *Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green*
> *We weave the marriage veils of a queen*

*   **Time of Day:** **Fall of night** (late evening/beginning of night). This time is linked to the end of childhood’s innocence.

*   **Garment and Stage of Life:** The weavers are weaving the **marriage veil** of a **queen**. This stage of life is **youth/marriage**.

#### Stanza III: Death (Moonlight Chill)

> *Weavers, weaving solemn and still*
> *What do you weave in the moonlight chill?*
> *White as a feather and white as a cloud*
> *We weave a dead man’s funeral shroud.*

*   **Time of Day:** **Moonlight chill** (late in the night/midnight).
*   **Mood:** The weavers are described as **solemn** (serious) and **still**. The phrase 'moonlight chill' indicates an **unpleasant coldness**, and this mood indicates **sadness**.
*   **Garment and Stage of Life:** They are weaving a thin **white cloth (shroud)** to cover a **dead man’s funeral** body. This stage of life is **death**.
*   **Colour and Comparison:** The shroud is **white**. White is often worn to visit someone who has lost a loved one, and it symbolizes death. The cloth is compared to a **feather and a cloud**, emphasizing its whiteness. Death.

### Part 3: Language and Literary Devices

#### 1. Simile
A simile is a literary device used to show a **comparison between two different things** due to some similarity, often using the words **‘as’ or ‘like’**.

*   **Examples from the poem:**
    *   Blue **as** the wing of halcyon wild.
    *   **Like** the plumes of a peacock, purple and green.
    *   White **as** a feather and white **as** a cloud.

#### 2. Rhythm and Repetition
Rhythm in writing is similar to the beat in music. In poetry, rhythm is achieved when certain words are produced more forcefully or held longer, and by **repeating words or phrases**.

*   **Repeated Phrases:** The poem achieves rhythm through the repetition of phrases:
    *   "Weavers, weaving..."
    *   "Why do you weave..."
    *   "We weave..."

#### 3. Imagery
The poem uses strong imagery, meaning that when you read or listen to it, you can create **clear pictures in your mind**.

*   **Images created include:** Weavers weaving at their looms; a bird with blue feathers; a peacock dancing/spreading its plumes; a queen with her face covered with a veil; and a dead body covered with a white cloth.

#### 4. Word Building (Suffixes)
New words for professions are often formed by adding the suffix ‘-er’ or ‘-or’ to verbs or nouns.
*   **Suffix ‘-er’ added to a verb:** *weave* $\to$ **weaver**.
*   **Suffix ‘-or’ added to a verb:** *direct* $\to$ **director**.

### Part 4: Coping with Emotions

The lesson also addresses the different emotions (happy and sad feelings) that correspond to the stages of life described in the poem.
