### Part 2: The Narrator and Shovan Lal (The Crisis and The Idea)

The narrator arrives in a big city (like Delhi/Connaught Circus) and is unemployed, holding only a five-rupee note and some loose change.

#### 1. The Meeting
*   The narrator was standing outside the Tea House in Connaught Circus, wondering if he could afford a cup of coffee and potato chips.
*   A shoeshine boy, **Shovan Lal**, approached him and persisted (continued) in asking, "Cream and polish sir?".
*   The narrator refused, smiling, "I can’t afford it," explaining, "I haven’t got four annas for a shoe polish".
*   The shoeshine boy was **puzzled and hurt**, thinking the educated man was making fun of him.

#### 2. Shovan Lal's Wisdom
*   Shovan Lal walked with the narrator and pointed out, “Can’t get a job with dirty shoes like that, sir. The boss sahibs won’t like it”.
*   The narrator asked Shovan Lal how much money he earned. Shovan Lal replied that on a bad day, he earned about **three rupees**, and on a good day (with lots of tourists), about **five rupees, or sometimes more**.

#### 3. The Realization and Proposal
*   The narrator did a quick calculation and realized that the shoeshine boy earned **more than Ram Singh, a government clerk**. This realization sent a shiver through him and provided a potential solution.
*   The narrator hesitantly asked Shovan Lal, **“Polish shoes? Like you, I mean?”**.
*   Shovan Lal was **shocked** ("stopping dead") and laughed loudly, refusing to believe the university-educated man was serious.

### Part 3: Overcoming Ego and Status Consciousness

The conversation between the educated narrator and Shovan Lal highlights the societal pressure regarding status and the stigma against manual labour.

#### 1. Shovan Lal's Arguments Against the Job
Shovan Lal argued strongly against the narrator taking up shoeshining, primarily based on status:
*   He believed that if *he* could speak English, he would be a "sahib" in an office, earning a regular monthly salary.
*   He questioned: "What would my friends say?".
*   He argued: **“But think of the status of working in an office with an electric fan over your head”**.

#### 2. The Narrator's Counter-Arguments
The narrator countered by emphasizing his immediate financial reality:
*   He explained he had no friends in Delhi and had left home without sitting through his exams.
*   Crucially, he pointed out that even if he got a clerk’s job, he would be earning **less than Shovan Lal**.
*   He concluded that he needed a job **straightaway**.

#### 3. Initial Hurdles and Cooperation
*   Shovan Lal warned that the narrator would face objections from the **Shoeshines’ Union** because Connaught Circus was profitable, and an extra shoeshine would reduce everyone else's earnings.
*   The narrator's immediate goal became persuading the others.
*   They realized the narrator needed equipment (box, brushes, cream, polish, rags) costing **ten or twelve rupees**. The narrator then revealed the "simple fact" that he only had **five rupees and some loose change**.

### Part 4: Interdependence and Success

The final part details how the narrator was accepted into the union, emphasizing the lesson's theme of cooperation.

#### 1. The Union’s Condition
*   Shovan Lal met the narrator later that night and introduced him to his friends, the members of the Shoeshines’ Union.
*   The union was currently having trouble with the **authorities** because polishing shoes on the pavement was **illegal, like begging**, as they had been refused a license.
*   The head of the Union admitted they needed help because they were having difficulty with their **correspondence** (letters) in English with the authorities.
*   Though most of the group was initially against letting him in, they **reluctantly agreed** to give him a chance **provided he helped out with the correspondence**.

#### 2. The Cooperative Gesture
*   The narrator "literally **jumped for joy**" at being accepted.
*   Shovan Lal told him that the Union members would **take a collection** for him to buy the box and materials.
*   This act allowed the narrator to **keep his five rupees** for food and other things until he began earning. The collected money would be paid back after a few weeks. A little over seven rupees was collected that evening in a toffee tin.

## Part 5: Language Focus (Clauses)

The lesson includes a detailed section on grammar, focusing on clauses in sentences.

### Clauses
A sentence with more than one clause can be split into parts, where each part has a subject and a verb.

1.  **Principal Clause (or Main Clause):** This clause is independent and can stand alone as a complete thought, even when linked to another clause.
2.  **Subordinate Clause (or Dependent Clause):** This clause is dependent and must be linked to the Principal Clause via a **subordinate sentence connector** (like *that*, *which*, or *though*) to make sense.

#### Functions of Subordinate Clauses
Subordinate clauses function similarly to parts of speech:
*   **Noun Clause:** Functions as a noun in the sentence (e.g., as the object of a verb).
    *   *Example:* Garima told her sister **that her classmates were planning to visit the Lotus Temple**.
*   **Adjective Clause:** Functions as an adjective, defining or describing a noun in the principal clause.
    *   *Example:* My father gave me a book **which has been published by NIOS**.
*   **Adverb Clause:** Functions as an adverb, often showing reasons, conditions, time, or place.
    *   *Example:* Gaurav will attend the meeting **though he is unwell these days** (showing condition/reason).
