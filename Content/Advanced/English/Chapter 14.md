I am pleased to continue our detailed lesson series. This explanation covers the lesson titled **"STEALING AND ATONEMENT,"** which features extracts from Mahatma Gandhi’s autobiography, *‘My Experiments with Truth’*. This lesson reveals important aspects of Gandhi’s childhood and teenage years, focusing on mistakes, guilt, confession, and the profound power of forgiveness (Ahimsa).

## Lesson 14: Stealing and Atonement (Extracts from Gandhi's Autobiography)

### Part 1: Objectives and Theme

The lesson allows you to observe how Gandhi learned the positive consequences of being truthful, even when it was difficult.

#### Key Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Observe how children learn by **imitating others**.
*   Recognise that children can **resist negative influences**.
*   Differentiate between **right and wrong choices**.
*   Realise the importance of **confessing one’s wrong doing**.
*   Use present and past participles.
*   Write short messages.

#### The Theme: Confession and Cleansing
The core theme revolves around the idea that all people make mistakes, especially during adolescence. However, the lesson stresses that a **clean confession, combined with a promise never to commit the sin again, is the purest type of repentance**. Gandhi’s experience demonstrates that confession is necessary for **cleansing** the heart and washing the sin away.

### Part 2: The Two Mistakes (Smoking and Stealing Money)

Gandhi's early mistakes stemmed from imitation and a desire for independence.

#### 1. Smoking and Petty Theft (Age 12 or 13)
*   **The Imitation:** Gandhi and a relative became fond of smoking not because they enjoyed the smell or saw good in it, but because they **imagined a sort of pleasure in emitting clouds of smoke**. They decided to copy the habit of Gandhi's uncle.
*   **The Problem:** They had no money.
*   **The Solutions:** They first collected cigarette **stubs** (ends) thrown away by the uncle. When that wasn't enough, they began to **steal coins from the servant’s pocket money** to purchase Indian cigarettes (beedis). They also tried smoking the porous stalks of a certain plant.

#### 2. The Desire for Independence and Suicide Attempt
*   Gandhi and his relative were far from satisfied; their **want (desire) of independence began to upset them**. They found it **unbearable** to do anything without the elders' permission.
*   **The Decision:** In "sheer disgust," they decided to commit suicide.
*   **The Failed Attempt:** They heard **dhatura seeds** were an effective poison. They went to the jungle, found the seeds, went to Kedarjee Mandir at the "auspicious hour" of evening, but their **courage failed them**.
    *   They feared they might not be instantly killed.
    *   They questioned the worth of killing themselves when they could simply "put up with the lack of independence".
    *   They swallowed only two or three seeds, fighting shy of death.
    *   They decided to go to Ramji Mandir to **compose themselves** and dismiss the thought of suicide.
*   **The Result:** The failed suicide attempt ultimately led them to bid good-bye to the habit of smoking stubs of cigarettes and stealing coppers. Gandhi regarded the habit of smoking as **barbarous, dirty and harmful** when he grew up.

#### 3. Stealing Gold (Age 15)
*   **The Second Theft:** This was more serious. Gandhi’s elder brother had run into a **debt of about twenty-five rupees**.
*   **The Action:** The brother wore an **armlet** of solid gold, and Gandhi **stole a bit of gold out of it** (by clipping it) to clear the debt.
*   **The Guilt:** The theft became "more than I could bear". Gandhi realised he had done something wrong and felt disturbed and unhappy. He resolved never to steal again.

### Part 3: The Atonement and Forgiveness

Gandhi's decision to confess to his father is the central act of **atonement** (making amends for wrongdoing).

#### 1. The Decision to Confess
*   Gandhi decided to confess to his father, but he **did not dare to speak**. He feared the **pain (agony)** he would cause his father, not that he feared being beaten, as he couldn't recall his father ever beating them.
*   He felt that the risk should be taken, believing there could be **no cleansing without a confession**.
*   **The Method:** He decided to **write out the confession** on a slip of paper and handed it to his father.

#### 2. The Confessional Note
In the note, Gandhi did four things:
1.  He **confessed his guilt**.
2.  He asked for **adequate (suitable) punishment** for it.
3.  He closed with a request to his father **not to punish himself** for the offence.
4.  He **pledged (promised)** himself never to steal in the future.

#### 3. The Father’s Reaction and the Lesson of Ahimsa
The father was confined to bed on a plain wooden plank.

*   **The Reaction:** The father read the note, and **tears trickled down his cheeks, wetting the paper**. He closed his eyes in thought and then **tore up the note**.
*   **The Son’s Realisation:** Gandhi also cried, seeing his father’s agony. He realised the tears were tears of **love and forgiveness**, which **cleansed his heart** and washed his sin away.
*   **Ahimsa Taught:** Gandhi knew then that this was **pure Ahimsa** (non-violence). The father did not scold, say hard things, or use any physical violence. His peaceful reaction taught Gandhi the real meaning of Ahimsa.
*   **Repentance:** Gandhi believed this **sublime (great) forgiveness** was due to his "clean confession," which increased his father's affection for him beyond measure.

### Part 4: Language and Grammar Focus

#### 1. Present Participle
The present participle is an **-ing** word that functions as an adjective to qualify a noun.

#### 2. Past Participle
The past participle is often formed by adding **–d** or **–n** to the verb (e.g., *tire* $\to$ *tired*, *broke* $\to$ *broken*). It functions as an adjective to qualify a noun.
*   *Example from the source:* Throw the **broken** glass away.

#### 3. Message Writing
A message is a short, clear, and accurate piece of information that needs to be conveyed.
*   **Format:** It is brief, deals only with important points, and typically includes time, date, a brief salutation (e.g., Krishnan), and the writer’s name.
*   **Style:** It does not include direct speech or address, though it sometimes contains a contact number.
