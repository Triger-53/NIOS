### Part 2: Part 1 — The Crisis and Jijabai's Resolve

Part 1 sets the tense situation after a letter arrives reporting Shivaji's death.

#### 1. The Letter and Disbelief
*   **The News:** Jijabai, the Regent, has received a letter from Agra reporting that Shivaji is dead.
*   **Jijabai's Reaction:** She is in disbelief and says the letter is a **hoax** (a trick or falsehood). She argues that Aurangzeb, the Moghul King, never tells the truth and made false promises to her son.
*   **The Mantri's Worry:** The Mantri expresses great anxiety. He reports that **Bijapur is about to strike**, **discontent is spreading** among their own men (who may revolt any day), and they have no news about Shivaji.
*   **Jijabai’s Orders:** Jijabai (sternly) commands the Mantri to stop speaking about the letter. She declares, **"The lion and his cub will soon return to their kingdom"** and cannot stay long in the **"fox’s den"** (referring to Aurangzeb’s prison).

#### 2. The Regent's Responsibility
Despite her own worry (the news of his death has upset her), Jijabai acts as a committed and earnest Regent to keep the morale of her people high.

*   **Financial Support:** She orders the Mantri to **raise the pay and increase the rations of the soldiers**.
*   **Morale Boost:** She instructs him to **send useful gifts to their wives and sweets and toys to their children**. She pays for everything out of her **private purse**.
*   **Spreading False Hope:** She instructs the Mantri to tell everyone that the Raja is at **Varanasi** and will return soon. She tells them to spread the news that astrologers have studied Shivaji's horoscope and say nothing can stop him from becoming the lord of Maharashtra.
*   **Leadership Quality:** Jijabai believes that keeping the soldiers and priests **"contended and happy"** will make them believe the words. This demonstrates that a true leader is always committed to his mission and responsible for his people.

### Part 3: Part 2 — The Return of the Lion

Part 2 details the arrival of three holy men (sadhus) and Shivaji's dramatic revelation.

#### 1. The Arrival of the Sadhus
*   **Jijabai’s Anxiety:** When an attendant reports that three holy men (bairagi sadhus) from the north are at the gate, Jijabai’s heart beats with anxiety.
*   **Reason for Admitting Them:** She agrees to see them because they are holy men who have travelled from afar. She is anxious that they may have news about her son, and she needs their blessings badly.
*   **The Sadhus’ News:** The second sadhu reports that at Varanasi, they heard Shivaji had gone to Agra, and later, they met horsemen who said the Raja **had been put in prison by Aurangzeb**.
*   **The Disguise:** The three sadhus seem poor and humble, dressed in rags. Two are tall, but the third is a **small man who keeps his eyes fixed to the ground**. The first sadhu claims the third sadhu has **taken a vow of silence**.

#### 2. The Recognition
Jijabai challenges the silent sadhu.

*   **The Challenge:** Jijabai, desperate to see her son, tells the third sadhu that if he will not bless her, he may **curse her, and she will die cheerfully**, as she cannot live without her son.
*   **The Revelation:** The third sadhu immediately **falls at her feet**. Jijabai gently passes her hand over his face, cries out, and draws his head to her breast, realizing **"It’s my son!"**.
*   **Motherly Instinct:** This emotional response shows that a mother, even though a ruler, is always a mother first, and her love and care for her children are natural.

#### 3. Shivaji’s Triumphant Return
*   **Shivaji’s Escape:** Shivaji reveals that he has escaped from the **"fox’s den and the vulture’s claws"** and later calls it the **"spider’s web"**.
    *   *(Do You Know):* Shivaji and his son, Sambhaji, had escaped from Aurangzeb's custody by hiding themselves in two large baskets used to pack fruit and sweetmeats for Brahmins and holy men.
*   **Sambhaji’s Safety:** Soyabai (Shivaji’s wife) asks nervously if he left their son behind. Shivaji assures her that Sambhaji is **"quite safe with friends"** and will join her in a few days.
*   **The Seasoned Ruler:** Shivaji, like a seasoned ruler, keeps his excitement subdued and makes his appearance in disguise. He immediately asks his teacher, Ram Das, for advice and guidance and then turns to his friends.
*   **The Celebration:** Shivaji orders a great celebration: light the torches on the hill-tops, illuminate the palace, fire the guns, and shout that the Raja has returned. They will also give a feast to the poor.
