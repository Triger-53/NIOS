## Lesson 7: Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Business Structures

This lesson teaches you about the immense importance of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the economy and the different legal structures an entrepreneur can choose for their business.

### I. Defining the Enterprise and MSMEs

#### A. Importance of MSMEs
MSMEs are rightly termed the **"engine of growth"** for India. They are the pillars of economic growth in many developed and developing countries.

MSMEs contribute significantly by:
1.  **Creating Employment:** Employing more than 50 million people, with a government target to raise this to at least 15 crore people.
2.  **Economic Contribution:** They currently form 8% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the government plans to raise this contribution to 50%.
3.  **Development and Equity:** They scale manufacturing capabilities, curtail regional disparities, and balance the distribution of wealth.

#### B. Key Definitions
*   **Business:** A human economic activity concerned with the production and distribution of goods and services with the objective of **earning profits**. Businesses can be privately owned, not-for-profit, or state-owned.
*   **Factory:** As defined by the Factories Act 1948, a factory is any premises where a manufacturing process is carried on:
    *   With the aid of power, provided 50 or more workers were working in the preceding 12 months.
    *   Without the aid of power, provided 100 or more workers were working in the preceding 12 months.
*   **Enterprise:** According to the MSME Act 2006, an enterprise means an industrial undertaking or business concern engaged in the **manufacture or production of goods** OR engaged in **providing or rendering of any service or services**.

#### C. MSME Classification (Revised 2020)
The definition of MSMEs in India is based on limits of **Investment** in Plant and Machinery or Equipment and **Turnover**:

| Category | Investment (Does Not Exceed) | Turnover (Does Not Exceed) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micro Enterprise** | One crore rupees (Rs 1 Cr) | Five crore rupees (Rs 5 Cr) |
| **Small Enterprise** | Ten crore rupees (Rs 10 Cr) | Fifty crore rupees (Rs 50 Cr) |
| **Medium Enterprise** | Fifty crore rupees (Rs 50 Cr) | Two hundred and fifty crore rupees (Rs 250 Cr) |

**Note:** **Investment** includes personal money or loans from banks, allocated in the expectation of some business benefit. **Turnover** is the amount derived from the provision of goods and services after deduction of trade discounts and taxes.

#### D. Manufacturing vs. Service Sector
An enterprise can be engaged in the Manufacturing Sector or the Service Sector:

| Feature | Manufacturing Sector | Service Sector |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product** | Tangible. A thing. | Intangible. An activity or process. |
| **Homogeneity** | Homogeneous (uniform). | Heterogeneous (varied). |
| **Core Value** | Processed in a factory. | Produced in the buyer-seller interaction. |
| **Production/Consumption** | Production and distribution are separated from consumption. | Production, distribution, and consumption are simultaneous. |
| **Inventory** | Can be kept in stock. | Cannot be kept in stock. |
| **Ownership** | Transfer of ownership occurs. | No transfer of ownership occurs. |

### II. Types of Business Structures

Entrepreneurs must register their enterprise under the appropriate government laws and procedures.

| Business Structure | Governing Act/Registration | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sole Proprietorship** | Does not require specific registration but advises SME/Udyog Aadhaar registration. | Owned, managed, and controlled by one person. Most common form for small businesses. The owner is advised to obtain GST registration if turnover exceeds Rs 20 lakhs or if selling online. |
| **Partnership Firm** | Indian Partnership Act, 1932. | Formed by two or more persons to run a business for profit. |
| **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)** | Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. | Minimum of 2 partners, with no upper limit. Requires a minimum of two designated partners (at least one resident in India) who are responsible for compliance. |
| **Company** | Companies Act 2013. | A legal entity formed by a group of individuals. Includes One Person Company (OPC), Private Limited Company (PLC), and Public Limited Company (PLC). A PLC is a voluntary association with separate legal existence and limited liability for its members. |
| **Cooperative Society** | Cooperative Act 1950 or relevant state acts. | An autonomous association of persons voluntarily united to meet common economic, social, and cultural needs through a jointly-owned enterprise. |

### III. Ease of Doing Business (EoDB)

The **Ease of Doing Business** (EoDB) index, created by Simeon Djankov and published yearly by the World Bank, defines the simplicity of business regulations and the strength of protections for property rights in a country. Higher rankings imply better business regulations.

#### A. Importance of EoDB
EoDB plays a crucial role in India's economic growth and in creating employment opportunities. When systems, processes, rules, and regulations are business-friendly, setting up businesses becomes easier, especially for smaller companies with less capital and resources.

#### B. India’s Ranking and Focus Areas
*   Sustained business reforms helped India jump **23 places** to move to the **77th position** in the 2018 global EoDB rankings.
*   India was recognized as a top global improver for a second consecutive year, carrying out reforms in areas like Starting a Business, Dealing with Construction Permits, Getting Electricity, Getting Credit, Paying Taxes, and Trading Across Borders.
*   State governments are setting up **single window systems** for approvals to improve their ranks across areas like construction permits, labour regulation, environmental registration, and easy loans.
