## Lesson 7: Entrepreneurial Values, Attitudes, and Ethics

This lesson covers the internal beliefs, external behaviours, and moral framework that guide an entrepreneur in their venture.

### I. Entrepreneurial Values

**Values** are the fundamental beliefs or convictions that guide an individual to choose a specific course of action over others. They define the good or bad considerations in any society and dictate how business affairs need to be conducted.

#### A. Features and Sources of Values
Values are central beliefs that are difficult to change and are generally permanent. They reflect standards of morality, describe the code of conduct, and influence entrepreneurial decisions.

An individual's value system is a combination of influences:
1.  **Family Factors:** Values are first learnt from the family (e.g., child rearing practices).
2.  **Social Factors:** Impact comes from social circles (e.g., discipline in school).
3.  **Personal Factors:** The individual’s personality, such as intelligence level, impacts their values.
4.  **Cultural Factors:** Values, beliefs, and norms passed down through generations (e.g., how to welcome guests).
5.  **Life Experience:** Learning from one's own actions and experiences influences the value system.

#### B. Core Values of Successful Entrepreneurs
Successful entrepreneurs generally possess the following values:

*   **Honesty:** Essential for sustaining business relationships with all stakeholders.
*   **Reliability:** Being reliable in all dealings, including the quality of products, services, and decisions.
*   **Respect:** Showing respect to all stakeholders (customers, suppliers, investors, workers) and respecting goals regarding work, time, and business.
*   **Foresighted:** The ability to assess future risks and plan business activities accordingly comes through education and intelligence.
*   **Innovation and Creativity:** The ability to **think out of the box**, manage change, deal with uncertainty, and portray originality.
*   **Outstanding Performance:** The drive to outperform competition, accept mistakes, and correct them, without resorting to shortcuts for quality.
*   **Independence:** Entrepreneurs value the **freedom to express themselves** and are self-motivated and self-reliant.

### II. Entrepreneurial Attitudes

**Attitudes** are psychological traits that shape people’s behaviour. They represent a predisposition to respond positively or negatively to something in one's environment. Attitudes are psychological phenomena, are pervasive, and are acquired over a period of time.

#### A. Essential Entrepreneurial Attitudes
Attitudes shape entrepreneurial behaviour, and certain traits are essential for success:

*   **Patience:** Entrepreneurship takes time to establish a brand image and business in the market.
*   **Positivity:** Required to take risks and ensure the successful future of the enterprise.
*   **Perseverance:** Putting in regular, hard work to achieve business goals.
*   **Resilience:** The ability to overcome difficulties, especially since entrepreneurs may be "cornered" for their career choice.
*   **Imagination:** Entrepreneurs are considered **visionaries** who use their imagination to tap market opportunities.
*   **Change:** Having a positive attitude towards change and modifying themselves accordingly.
*   **Performance:** The ability to complete tasks against all odds.
*   **Networking:** Generally maintaining a good network circle.
*   **Respect:** Maintaining a positive attitude towards all stakeholders.

### III. Business Ethics

**Ethics** are the rule of conduct or moral principles concerning acceptable and unacceptable actions in any society. **Business ethics** specifically apply these moral principles to business policies, institutions, and the behaviour of entrepreneurs.

#### A. Factors Governing Business Ethics
Ethics are governed by both external structures and internal policies:

1.  **Legislative Framework:** Laws provide the basic ethical standards that must be followed.
2.  **Regulatory Framework of the Government:** The government checks adherence to ethical practices and sets minimum standards (e.g., for product quality), often using campaigns like *Jago Grahak Jago* to make customers aware of defaults.
3.  **Corporate Ethical Codes:** Companies often establish their own ethical standards, which are circulated and must be followed by all employees.
4.  **Societal Obligations:** Social pressures significantly impact the ethical structure of businesses (e.g., the pressure for providing maternity leave).
5.  **Entrepreneurial Vision and Mission:** The founder’s vision and mission influence the business’s ethical standards (e.g., the reputation of Tata for ethical standards).

#### B. Rationale for Business Ethics
Following ethical practices is vital for entrepreneurs:

*   **Survival:** A business cannot sustain itself long-term if stakeholders feel it is engaging in unethical practices.
*   **Stable Society:** Ethical practices help establish a stable society, which in turn aids economic and social development.
*   **Credibility:** An ethical enterprise gains more credibility and trust from the society and customers.
*   **Coordination and Decision-Making:** Ethics help achieve better coordination among stakeholders and aid in decision-making by clarifying what is right and wrong.
*   **Profits:** Ethical practices build reputation, which leads to long-term survival and profitability.

## Lesson 8: Achievement Motivation and Self-Improvement

**Motivation** is the enthusiasm toward work, defined as the complex forces that start and keep a person working in an organisation. It is a psychological process driven by unsatisfied needs.

#### A. Features and Significance of Motivation
Motivation is generally an **internal feeling** that is dynamic (needs and goals keep changing) and continuous, requiring ongoing effort. It is distinct from **satisfaction**, which comes *after* a target is achieved.

Motivation is significant because it creates the **will to work**, increases **efficiency** and **cooperation**, and results in **low labour absenteeism** and **low wastage** of raw materials.

#### B. Types of Motivators
Motivators are broadly classified into financial (monetary) and non-financial (secondary) types:

| Financial Motivators (Primary) | Non-Financial Motivators (Secondary) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Salary/Wages:** Basic compensation paid at fixed intervals. | **Prestige/Status:** Comes from position in the hierarchy; best for employees whose basic needs are fulfilled. |
| **Allowances:** Monetary benefits given above salary to meet specific expenditures (e.g., HRA, DA). | **Job Security:** Stability in employment; reduces fear of dismissal, leading to better work performance. |
| **Perquisites:** Non-monetary benefits given by virtue of employment (e.g., rent-free accommodation, company car). | **Organisational Environment:** A cohesive or positive culture with good relations between peers and supervisors. |
| **Bonus:** Monetary benefit usually paid for achieving goals or ceremonially (e.g., Diwali bonus). | **Recognition:** Acknowledging and rewarding employee efforts to boost morale. |
| **Profit Sharing:** Sharing a percentage of profits as an incentive (only if profit is earned). | **Career Advancement:** Providing growth opportunities within the organisation (e.g., promotion). |
| **Co-partnership:** Employees share profits and also **ownership** and participate in control/management. | **Enriched Jobs:** Increasing the relative importance of the job, giving employees better rights and decision-making responsibilities. |
| **Gratuity:** Sum of money paid by employer for services, usually at retirement. | **Participation of Employees:** Including employees in goal-setting, leading to high motivation and attachment to goals. |

#### C. Theories of Motivation

Motivation theories help determine which motivator is best suited for a situation.

1.  **McClelland’s Three-Need Model**
    *   **Need for Achievement (n-Ach):** The compelling drive to do things better and more efficiently than others. High achievers prefer challenging roles, quick feedback, and are intrinsically goal-driven.
    *   **Need for Power (n-Pow):** The desire to control and direct others. This power can be used for personal gain or institutionalized for organizational betterment.
    *   **Need for Affiliation (n-Aff):** The need to be known and adored; individuals prefer cohesive, cooperative situations and gain intrinsic satisfaction from socializing.

2.  **Maslow’s Need Hierarchy Theory**
    Maslow hypothesized that human needs are ranked in order of preference, and a satisfied need ceases to be a motivator.
    *   **1. Physiological Needs:** Basic survival needs (food, shelter, clothing, air, water). This is the starting point for motivation.
    *   **2. Safety and Security Needs:** Includes physical safety (from accidents/disease) and economic safety (security of income and old age provisions).
    *   **3. Social Needs:** The need for companionship, interaction, and sharing of feelings.
    *   **4. Ego Needs (Esteem):** Includes internal needs (self-confidence, competence) and external needs (status, prestige).
    *   **5. Self-Fulfilment Needs:** The highest need; the desire for personal achievement and fulfilling one's mission in life, resulting in psychological satisfaction.

#### D. Locus of Control and SWOT Analysis

Entrepreneurs often use self-analysis tools to gauge their potential.

1.  **Locus of Control (LOC)**
    This is the extent to which an individual believes they control the outcomes of their actions.
    *   **Internal Locus of Control:** Individuals believe they drive their destinies, giving credit to their own efforts for results.
    *   **External Locus of Control:** Individuals attribute results (good or bad) to external factors, like luck or other people.

2.  **SWOT Analysis (Self-Analysis)**
    Developed by Albert Humphrey, SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a comparative technique used to identify and harness internal advantages and exploit external factors.

| Internal Factors (SW) | External Factors (OT) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Strengths:** Advantages a person has over competitors (e.g., better skills, connections). | **Opportunities:** External forces that a person can exploit or take benefit of (e.g., a competitor leaving the market, new technologies). |
| **Weaknesses:** Disadvantageous features or "toxic traits" a person has in relation to competitors (e.g., lack of skills, need for education). | **Threats:** External forces that may cause trouble or hinder the way (e.g., being afraid to change, being challenged by another person). |

For a SWOT analysis to be effective, one must be truthful, compare against competitors, and focus on opportunities and threats that are **unique** to oneself.

### II. Case Studies of Successful Entrepreneurs

These examples illustrate how entrepreneurial traits manifest in diverse fields:

1.  **Ramesh Babu (First Generation, Car Rental):**
    *   **Persistence/Vision:** He came from a humble background (father was a barber) and worked hard. Driven by his dream to own a car, he started by renting out a Maruti Omni, eventually transforming this passion into a highly successful luxury car rental business, *Ramesh Tours and Travels*. He was among the first to see the gap in the market for renting luxury cars to delegates (buying his first E class Mercedes).
2.  **Mark Zuckerberg (Young Entrepreneur, Facebook):**
    *   **Creativity/Vision:** He developed an interest in programming early (Zucknet at 12). He identified a social need on campus and co-created "The Facebook". He demonstrated **commitment** by dropping out of college to pursue the site full-time, leading to rapid expansion and massive global usage.
3.  **Jyoti Naik (Women Entrepreneur, Lijjat Papad):**
    *   **Persistence/Integrity:** This organisation, *Shri Mahila Griha Udyog*, started in 1959 with seven women and a borrowed sum of ₹80. They were guided by a policy of **self-reliance** (never accepting donations) and **quality consciousness**. This commitment and adherence to core values led to the organization’s success, transforming the lives of over 43,000 women and generating over ₹800 crore in annual sales by 2018.
4.  **Radhaambika S. (PwD Entrepreneur, Avionics):**
    *   **Resilience/Empowerment:** Despite being stricken by polio, she pursued a course and received special training at ISRO. She established *Sivavasu Electronics Industries Pvt. Ltd.* in Kerala, producing electronic components essential for the navigation and guidance of India’s rockets (including Chandrayaan-1 and Mangalyaan). Her commitment extends to social contribution; she has trained over 750 women, many of whom are physically challenged or from deprived families, earning a national award for Best Employer for the Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.
5.  **Kong Kara (Food Entrepreneur, Kara’s Fresh Foods):**
    *   **Perseverance/Commitment:** Inheriting a passion for food processing (pickle making), she was inspired by appreciation to turn her hobby into a business. She demonstrated commitment by seeking formal training repeatedly (Department of Food and Nutrition, Department of Horticulture) to improve her professional skills. She maintains strict hygiene standards and helps other aspiring entrepreneurs through training and internships.
6.  **Chetna Gala Sinha (Social Entrepreneur, Mann Deshi Bank):**
    *   **Non-Acceptance of Status Quo/Persistence:** She started by petitioning for basic services like toilets and electricity in her village. When the RBI rejected her proposal to open a cooperative bank for rural women because they were illiterate, she motivated the women to become literate and successfully convinced officials of their ability to calculate interest orally. This led to the creation of **Mann Deshi Mahila Sahakari Bank**, India's first bank *for and by rural women*, providing financial backing and confidence to thousands of women entrepreneurs.
7.  **Mansukh Bhai Prajapati (Rural Entrepreneur, Mitticool):**
    *   **Innovation/Resilience:** A traditional clay craftsman, Mansukh Bhai suffered huge losses in the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. Inspired by a newspaper caption ("Fridge of the Poor got broken"), he developed **Mitticool**, a clay fridge that preserves food taste, works without electricity (on the same principle as earthen pots), and has no periodical costs. He collaborated with institutions like GIAN and NID for product improvement and market expansion, demonstrating a continuous drive for innovation.
