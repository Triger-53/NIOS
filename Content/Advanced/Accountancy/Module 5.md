This next step in accountancy involves preparing the crucial summary reports that communicate the financial performance and position of a business—the **Financial Statements**.

We will cover the preparation, objectives, and components of these statements, first focusing on preparing them directly from the Trial Balance (without adjustments) and then explaining why and how crucial **Adjustments** are made to ensure accuracy.

# I. Financial Statements: Meaning and Objectives

Every business eagerly waits to know the result of its activities for a particular financial year, similar to a student waiting for an annual examination result. The statements prepared for this purpose are called **Financial Statements**.

Financial statements are prepared yearly to ascertain the **Gross Profit**, **Net Profit** (or loss) earned during a period, and the **position of its assets and liabilities** on a specific date, generally the last date of the accounting year.

## A. Classification of Financial Statements
For a sole trader, financial statements comprise two main categories:
1.  **Income Statement:** Prepared to find out the profit or loss of the business for an accounting year. This is composed of the **Trading Account** and the **Profit and Loss Account**.
2.  **Position Statement (Balance Sheet):** Prepared to know the financial position of the business on a particular date.

## B. Objectives of Preparing Financial Statements
The main goals of preparing these statements are:
*   **Ascertaining Business Results:** To find out the profit earned or loss incurred during a particular accounting period.
*   **Ascertaining Financial Position:** The Balance Sheet provides information about the state of assets and liabilities on a particular date.
*   **Correct Decision Making:** The information helps in taking future business decisions correctly.
*   **Judging Management Performance:** They help in evaluating how well the resources of the business have been utilized.
*   **Ascertaining Cash Position:** The cash position indicated assists the business in planning payments to creditors, suppliers, etc..

# II. The Income Statement

The Income Statement is prepared in two parts to progressively refine the profit figure from Gross Profit to Net Profit.

## A. Trading Account (To Ascertain Gross Profit)

The **Trading Account** is prepared to find out the **Gross Profit** earned or **Gross Loss** suffered by the business from its core trading activities during an accounting year.

*   **Format:** It is prepared in a **T-form**.
*   **Debit Side:** All items related to the costs of buying, manufacturing, and bringing the goods to the place of sale (known as **Direct Expenses**) are shown on the debit side.
    *   *Items Debited:* Opening Stock, Net Purchases (Purchases minus Purchase Returns), Direct Expenses like Wages, Freight Inward, Carriage Inward, Fuel & Power, and Factory Rent.
*   **Credit Side:** All its core trading activities during an accounting year.

*   **Format:** It is prepared in a **T-form**.
*   **Debit Side:** All items related to the costs of buying, manufacturing, and bringing the goods to the place of sale (known as **Direct Expenses**) are shown on the debit side.
    *   *Items Debited:* Opening Stock, Net Purchases (Purchases minus Purchase Returns), Direct Expenses like Wages, Freight Inward, Carriage Inward, Fuel & Power, and Factory Rent.
*   **Credit Side:** All direct revenue items related to sales are shown on the credit side.
    *   *Items Credited:* Net Sales (Sales minus Sales Returns) and Closing Stock.
*   **Balancing Figure:**
    *   If the **Credit side total is greater**, the difference is **Gross Profit**, which is transferred to the debit side of the P&L A/c.
    *   If the **Debit side total is greater**, the difference is **Gross Loss**, which is transferred to the credit side of the P&L A/c.

## B. Profit and Loss Account (To Ascertain Net Profit)

The **Profit and Loss Account (P&L A/c)** is prepared after the Trading Account to find the **Net Profit** or **Net Loss** of the business during an accounting year.

*   **Format:** It is also prepared in a T-form.
*   **Debit Side:** This side records the Gross Loss (if applicable) and all **Indirect Expenses** relating to the running and administration of the business.
    *   *Items Debited:* Gross Loss (transferred from Trading A/c), Office Salaries, Office Rent, Printing & Stationery, Insurance Premium, Interest Paid, Freight Outwards, Discount Allowed to customers, and Telephone Charges.
*   **Credit Side:** This side records the Gross Profit (transferred from Trading A/c) and all **Indirect Revenue** (income earned outside of core trading activity).
    *   *Items Credited:* Gross Profit (transferred from Trading A/c), Commission Received, Discount Received from creditors, Rent Received, and Interest Received.
*   **Balancing Figure:**
    *   If the **Credit side total is greater**, the difference is **Net Profit**, which is transferred to the owner’s **Capital Account**.
    *   If the **Debit side total is greater**, the difference is **Net Loss**, which is transferred to the owner’s **Capital Account**.

| Distinction | Trading Account | Profit and Loss Account |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Result** | Shows the **gross profit** or gross loss. | Shows the **net profit** or net loss. |
| **Expenses** | Deals with all **direct expenses** (e.g., wages, factory lighting). | Deals with all **indirect expenses** (e.g., salaries, rent paid). |
| **Final Balance** | Transferred to the P&L A/c. | Transferred to the **Capital Account** of the proprietor. |

# III. The Position Statement (Balance Sheet)

The **Balance Sheet** is prepared after the Trading and P&L Accounts to know the **financial position** of a business on a **particular date**.

## A. Structure and Components
The Balance Sheet is a statement (not an account) with two sides, where the total of both sides must always be **equal**.

1.  **Liabilities Side (Left Hand Side):** Used for showing liabilities, which are obligations or debts payable by the business.
    *   **Internal Liabilities:** The amount payable by the business to its owner (e.g., **Capital**, Reserves, Profits of the business).
    *   **External Liabilities:** The amount payable to outsiders (e.g., Creditors, Bank Loan, Bills Payable, Bank Overdraft, Expenses Payable or Due).
    *   **Capital Adjustment:** The starting Capital is adjusted by **adding Net Profit** (or subtracting Net Loss) and **subtracting Drawings**.

2.  **Assets Side (Right Hand Side):** Used for showing assets, which are resources owned by the business.
    *   **Fixed Assets:** Assets acquired not for resale, but for long-term use, such as Land and Building, Plant & Machinery, Furniture, and Motor Vehicles.
    *   **Current Assets:** Assets expected to be converted into cash within a short period, such as Cash in hand, Cash at Bank, Debtors, and Stock of goods.

## B. Objectives of the Balance Sheet
The main objectives are:
*   To know the overall financial position of the business.
*   To know the standing of internal and external liabilities so that timely arrangements can be made for their payment.
*   To know the position of fixed assets and current assets.
*   To plan future activities based on the present financial position.

# IV. Financial Statements with Adjustments

When preparing final accounts, it is essential to incorporate **Adjustments** to ensure the financial statements present a **correct picture** of the business.

## A. Need for Accounting Adjustments
If the figures from the Trial Balance do not fully account for all expenses and incomes relating to the current accounting year, the net profit and financial position will be incorrect. Adjustments are required:
1.  To know the **correct net profit** or net loss.
2.  To know the **correct financial position**.
3.  To record expenses that are due but not yet paid (Outstanding Expenses).
4.  To record expenses that have been paid in advance (Prepaid Expenses).
5.  To provide for the decrease in value of fixed assets (**Depreciation**).

## B. Accounting Treatment of Common Adjustments
Crucially, because an adjustment item appears *outside* the Trial Balance, it affects two accounts and must be shown in **two places** in the final statements:

### 1. Closing Stock
Closing stock is the stock of goods that remains unsold at the end of the accounting year.
*   **Treatment 1:** Shown on the **Credit side of the Trading Account**.
*   **Treatment 2:** Shown on the **Assets side of the Balance Sheet**.
    *   *Note:* If closing stock is given *inside* the Trial Balance, it is shown only on the assets side of the Balance Sheet.

### 2. Outstanding Expenses (O/S)
These are expenses that relate to the current year but have **not been paid** by the year-end (e.g., outstanding salaries, wages). This is a current liability.
*   **Treatment 1 (Adding to Expense):** **Added** to the relevant expense account (Wages in Trading A/c, or Salaries/Rent in P&L A/c) to account for the full year's expense.
*   **Treatment 2 (Liability):** Shown on the **Liabilities side of the Balance Sheet**.

### 3. Prepaid Expenses (P/P)
These are expenses paid during the current year but relate to the **future accounting year** (e.g., prepaid insurance, rent paid in advance). This is a current asset.
*   **Treatment 1 (Deducting from Expense):** **Deducted** from the relevant expense account in the P&L A/c to show only the current year's actual expense.
*   **Treatment 2 (Asset):** Shown on the **Assets side of the Balance Sheet**.

### 4. Depreciation on Fixed Assets
Depreciation is the decrease in the value of fixed assets due to their use or wear and tear. (This concept was detailed in our previous conversation, but here we cover its financial statement application.)
*   **Treatment 1 (Expense):** Debited to the **Profit and Loss Account**.
*   **Treatment 2 (Asset Reduction):** **Deducted** from the value of the concerned fixed asset on the **Assets side of the Balance Sheet**.
