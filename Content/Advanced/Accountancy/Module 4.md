# I. Depreciation

**Depreciation** is the portion of the cost of fixed assets charged each year as an expense. It represents the expense charged during a year for the **reduction in the value of fixed assets**.

## A. Understanding Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Fixed assets (like buildings, machinery, furniture, and motor vehicles) are long-term assets that provide benefits to the business for more than one year. They are acquired not as goods for resale, but to increase the business’s earning capacity.

Since the benefit of a fixed asset is enjoyed over many years, it would be incorrect to deduct the entire cost of the asset from the profit of only one year. Therefore, the correct accounting procedure is to **distribute the cost of the fixed asset over the years of its useful life** to the business.

## B. Causes of Depreciation
Depreciation is provided in accounts for several reasons:

1.  **Normal Wear and Tear:**
    *   **Due to Usage:** As an asset is put to use, its worth decreases (e.g., loss of efficiency in a bicycle due to running).
    *   **Due to Passage of Time:** Elements like wind, sun, and rain cause physical deterioration even if the asset is not used (e.g., reduction in furniture worth over time).
2.  **Obsolescence:** This is the loss in value due to external, non-physical factors.
    *   **Improved or Superior Equipment:** Assets may be discarded before they are physically worn out because newer equipment allows for cheaper, non-competitive production (e.g., steam engines becoming obsolete with the arrival of diesel locomotives).
    *   **Change in Market Conditions:** Changes in fashion, style, taste, or market conditions can reduce the value of assets engaged in producing goods that are no longer popular (e.g., machines for making old-fashioned hats).

## C. Objectives of Charging Depreciation
Charging depreciation fulfills critical financial reporting goals:

1.  **To Show the True Financial Position:** Depreciation is the gradual loss in the value of fixed assets.
    *   If depreciation is not provided, the Profit and Loss Account (P&L A/c) will **overstate the profit** made during the accounting period.
    *   The Balance Sheet will **overvalue fixed assets**, failing to disclose the true financial position.
2.  **To Retain Funds for Replacement:** Net profit may be withdrawn by the owner. By providing for depreciation, the reported net profit is reduced, which means the amount withdrawn by the owner is also decreased. The cash equivalent to the depreciation charge is effectively left in the business, allowing this accumulated amount to be used later to replace the old asset.

## D. Factors Affecting Depreciation Calculation
Four main factors determine the amount of depreciation charged on an asset:

1.  **Cost of Asset:** This includes the purchase price plus **all expenses incurred before the asset is first put to use** (e.g., loading, carriage, installation, transportation, and erection costs).
2.  **Useful Life of the Asset:** This is the expected number of years the asset will remain in use.
3.  **Scrap Value (or Residual Value):** This is the residual amount the asset is expected to fetch when sold as scrap after its useful life is over.
4.  **Depreciable Value of Asset:** This is the **Cost of Asset minus the Scrap Value**.

$$ \text{Depreciable Value} = \text{Cost of Asset} - \text{Scrap Value} $$

## E. Methods of Charging Depreciation

The two most popular methods are the Straight Line Method (SLM) and the Diminishing Balance Method (DBM).

### 1. Straight Line Method (SLM)
*   **Meaning:** Under this method, the amount of depreciation charged is **uniform** (the same) from year to year.
*   **Alternative Names:** It is also called the **Fixed Installment Method** or the **Original Cost Method** because the depreciation rate is always applied to the original cost of the asset.
*   **Calculation:**
    $$ \text{Depreciation of one Year} = \frac{\text{Cost of Assets} - \text{Estimated Scrap Value}}{\text{Number of years of expected life}} \text{ (or Annual Depreciation Amount)} $$
    If no scrap value is realized, the entire cost is divided by the expected life.
*   **Merits:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Calculation is very simple, as the amount is written off each year.
    *   **Asset Completely Written Off:** The book value of the asset is reduced exactly to its net scrap value (or zero) at the end of its useful life.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Difficulty in Computation:** If there are many machines with different life spans, calculation is complicated because each must be calculated separately.
    *   **Illogical Burden:** Repair and maintenance expenses tend to *increase* as an asset ages. Since depreciation remains constant, the **total burden on the P&L A/c (Depreciation + Repairs)** is higher in later years compared to earlier years, which is illogical because the asset’s efficiency is greater in the initial years.

### 2. Diminishing Balance Method (DBM)
*   **Meaning:** Under this method, the amount of depreciation charged goes on **declining** year after year.
*   **Alternative Names:** It is also known as the **Reducing Balance Method** or the **Written Down Value (WDV) Method**.
*   **Calculation:** The amount of depreciation is calculated as a fixed percentage of the **diminishing value (or written-down value)** of the asset shown in the books at the beginning of each year.
    *   *Example:* If the cost is ₹40,000 and the rate is 10%. Year 1 depreciation is ₹4,000 (10% of ₹40,000). The book value becomes ₹36,000. Year 2 depreciation is ₹3,600 (10% of ₹36,000).
*   **Merits:**
    *   **Equal Burden on P&L Account:** Because depreciation charges are higher in the initial years and repair expenses are lower, while in later years depreciation is lower and repair expenses are higher, the **total burden on the P&L A/c (Depreciation + Repairs)** remains somewhat equal throughout the period. This is logical, as the asset provides greater productivity in earlier years.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Asset Cannot Be Completely Written Off:** The value of the asset is **never reduced to zero** under this method, even if there is no scrap value.
    *   **Complexity:** The rate of depreciation cannot be determined easily.

# II. Provisions and Reserves

While depreciation accounts for known asset wear and tear, **Provisions and Reserves** are set aside from current earnings to account for current and future contingencies.

## A. Provision: Meaning and Need

A **Provision** is an estimated amount set aside to meet an **uncertain loss or expense** in the future.

### 1. Provision vs. Liability
If an amount payable in the future is certain (e.g., fixed outstanding rent), it is recorded as a definite **liability**. However, if the amount of the liability or expected loss is **not certain** but is known to exist, an estimated amount is set aside by debiting the Profit and Loss Account, and this is called a Provision.

*Examples of Provisions:* Provision for Depreciation, Provision for Doubtful Debts, Provision for Discount on Debtors.

### 2. Needs and General Rules for Provision
Provisions are necessary to ensure known liabilities or specific reductions in asset values are accounted for.

*   **Creation:** A provision is created by **debiting the Profit and Loss Account**.
*   **Mandatory:** Provision for a known liability or contingency (like depreciation) **must be created** irrespective of whether the business makes a profit or a loss.
*   **Use:** It is created for a known liability, even if the exact amount is uncertain (e.g., provision for doubtful debts).
*   **Distribution:** A provision is **not available for distribution as dividend** among shareholders.
*   **Presentation:** It is generally shown on the **liability side of the balance sheet** or on the assets side as a negative asset.

## B. Reserve: Meaning and Creation

A **Reserve** is an amount set aside out of profits or accumulated profits to strengthen the financial position of the business. It is money saved from current income to meet unexpected happenings in the future.

### 1. Reserve vs. Provision
*   **Charge vs. Appropriation:** A reserve is an **appropriation of profits** (post-profit matter), not a charge against profits (pre-profit matter like provision).
*   **Condition:** A reserve **can be created only when there is profit** in the business.
*   **Liability Coverage:** Reserves are **not meant to cover any known liability or depreciation** in the value of assets; they are kept aside for unknown liabilities or future emergencies.

### 2. Types of Reserves
Reserves are usually shown on the liability side of the balance sheet.

| Reserve Type | Description and Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General Reserve** | Not tied to any specific purpose; used to meet any future contingency or unknown liability. Created out of revenue profits to strengthen the general financial position. It is a **free reserve** available for dividend distribution. |
| **Capital Reserve** | Created out of **capital profits** (profits not earned in the regular course of business), such as premium on issue of shares, profit on sale of fixed assets, or profit prior to incorporation. **Generally not available for distribution as dividend**. Utilized for writing off capital losses (e.g., goodwill or preliminary expenses) or issuing bonus shares. |
| **Revenue Reserve** | Appropriation from revenue profits that **can be distributed by way of cash dividends**. |
| **Specific Reserve** | Created for a **specific purpose** and utilized only for that purpose (e.g., Dividend Equalization Reserves, Investment Fluctuation Reserves). |
| **Secret Reserve (Hidden Reserve)** | A reserve **not shown in the balance sheet**. Its existence is undisclosed, strengthening confidence and stability. Not created by joint stock companies, except for banking, insurance, and financing companies. |
| **Reserve Fund** | Created when a part of the profit set aside is **invested outside the business** in readily realizable securities. The use of the term ‘fund’ indicates external investment. |
| **Sinking Fund** | A fund built up by annual contributions that are **invested outside the business** for a **definite period**. Used for the future redemption of long-term debts/liabilities or replacement of assets. A sinking fund for asset replacement is a **provision**, while one for loan repayment is an **appropriation of profit**.

## C. Key Differences between Provision and Reserve

| Basis | Provision | Reserve |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Creation/Charge** | A **charge against profits** (mandatory for true profit ascertainment). Created by debiting the P&L A/c. | An **appropriation of profits** (optional, based on management discretion). Created by debiting the P&L Appropriation A/c. |
| **Profit Requirement**| Has to be provided even if there is loss or no profit. | Can be created **only when there is profit**. |
| **Purpose** | Created for a **known liability** or diminution in asset value, the amount of which cannot be accurately ascertained (e.g., bad debts). | Created to meet an **unknown liability**, strengthen the financial position, or for dividend equalization. |
| **Distribution** | Cannot be distributed as dividend. | Can be distributed as dividend (except for Capital Reserves). |
