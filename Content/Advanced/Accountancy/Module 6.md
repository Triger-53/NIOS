# I. Computers and their Characteristics

## A. Definition of a Computer
A **computer** is an **electronic device** that performs a variety of operations based on a set of instructions called a **program**. It is essentially a fast data processing electronic machine.

A computer transforms data (which can be marks, names, age, savings, etc.) into desired information. It functions by accepting data, storing data, processing data as desired, retrieving the stored data, and printing the result in a desired format.

## B. Characteristics of a Computer
A computer possesses several characteristics that make it superior to human beings in various aspects:

1.  **Speed:** Computers can access and process data millions of times faster than humans. Most modern computers can perform 100 million calculations per second. All operations are caused by electrical pulses that travel at the speed of light.
2.  **Storage:** Computers have a very large storage capacity, capable of storing vast amounts of data, information, pictures, and sound in digital form within a small physical space.
3.  **Accuracy:** The accuracy of a computer is very high, and every calculation is performed with the same accuracy. Errors typically occur due to human factors, such such as a wrong program by the user or inaccurate data, rather than technological weakness.
4.  **Diligence:** A computer is free from **tiredness and lack of concentration**. It can perform millions of calculations, doing the last one with the same accuracy and speed as the first.
5.  **Versatility:** A computer can perform a wide range of jobs—such as accounting, preparing bills, sending emails, and playing games—all with speed, accuracy, and diligence.
6.  **Communication:** Computers are used as powerful communication tools, often connected within an office network via cables, enabling communication among colleagues.
7.  **Processing Power:** Computers have evolved to become faster, smaller, cheaper, more reliable, and user-friendly.

## C. Components of a Computer
A computer system consists of three major components:

1.  **Input Unit:** Controls various input devices used to enter data into the computer. Common input devices include the keyboard, mouse, and scanner. Other devices are magnetic tape, bar code reader, and smart card reader. The input unit converts the input into the binary system.
2.  **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** Known as the **brain of the computer**, the CPU guides, directs, and governs its performance. It stores programs, photos, graphics, and data, and obeys instructions in the program.
    *   **Control Unit:** Controls and co-ordinates the activities of all computer components.
    *   **Memory Unit:** Stores data before it is actually processed. Instructions and data are stored here and accessed for processing.
    *   **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Responsible for performing all arithmetical calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical functions (comparisons).
3.  **Output Unit:** Ensures the conversion of processed data into a **human readable form** that the user can understand. Commonly used output devices include the monitor, plotter, printer, and speaker.

## D. Limitations of a Computer
Despite their advantages, computers have several limitations:

1.  **High Cost of Installation:** Hardware and software must be updated frequently as new versions become available, resulting in heavy costs.
2.  **High Cost of Training:** New hardware and software require training for personnel to ensure efficient use, incurring training costs.
3.  **Self-Decision Making Not Possible:** A computer cannot make decisions like human beings; it must be guided by the user and can only work the way it is programmed.
4.  **Costly Maintenance:** Computers require proper maintenance and a neat, clean, and controlled temperature environment to work efficiently.
5.  **Health Dangers:** Extensive computer use can lead to health problems such as muscular pain, eyestrain, and backache, which adversely affect working efficiency and increase medical expenditure.

# II. Computerized Accounting and Its Need

With the expansion of business, the number of transactions has increased, making the manual method of record-keeping unmanageable. The manual method is gradually being replaced by computerized accounting, which uses database technology.

## A. Role and Application in Accounting
The maintenance of accounting records has become more convenient with computerized accounting. This system uses the concept of **databases** and implements an accounting software (like Tally, Cash Manager, Busy).

Applications of computers in accounting include:

1.  **Preparation of Accounting Documents:** Preparing documents like Cash memos, Bills, Invoices, and accounting vouchers.
2.  **Recording of Transactions:** Business transactions are recorded daily using computer software. A logical scheme for codification is used, assigning a unique code to every account and transaction to simplify the recording process.
3.  **Preparation of Trial Balance and Financial Statements:** After recording, the computer automatically transfers data to ledger accounts. The Trial Balance is prepared to check accuracy, and the computer can then be programmed to prepare the Trading Account, Profit and Loss Account, and Balance Sheet.

## B. The Transaction Processing System (TPS)
**Transaction Processing System (TPS)** is the first stage of the computerized accounting system. The purpose of TPS is to record, process, validate, and store transactions occurring in various functional areas of a business for subsequent retrieval.

TPS involves the following steps:
1.  **Data Entry:** The process presumes that data is entered by the user.
2.  **Data Validation:** Ensures the accuracy and reliability of the input data by comparing it with predefined standards (e.g., checking a customer's PIN against known data). This includes error detection and correction procedures.
3.  **Processing and Revalidation:** Processing occurs rapidly (Online Transaction Processing, OLTP) provided valid data is fed (check input validity). Revalidation checks that the transaction is fully completed (check output validity).
4.  **Storage:** Only valid, processed actions are stored in the transaction database.
5.  **Information:** Stored data is processed using Query facilities to produce desired information.
6.  **Reporting:** Reports are prepared based on the required information content for decision usefulness.

## C. Need for Computerized Accounting
The need for computerized accounting is driven by its advantages in speed, accuracy, and lower cost:

*   **Numerous Transactions:** Capable of handling a large number of transactions with speed and accuracy.
*   **Instant Reporting:** Provides quick and quality reporting due to its speed and accuracy.
*   **Reduction in Paperwork:** Reduces the need for physical storage space, stationary, and books of accounts associated with large volumes of transactions in manual systems.
*   **Flexible Reporting:** Can generate reports for any required duration or specific balance as and when needed, unlike the periodic reports of manual systems.
*   **On-line Facility:** Offers online capability to store and process data, retrieve information, and generate financial reports.
*   **Scalability:** Fully equipped to handle the growing volume of transactions of a fast-growing business without significant additional cost for processing.
*   **Accuracy and Reliability:** The information content is accurate and reliable for decision-making, unlike manual systems where large numbers of transactions processed by many people can lead to inaccurate reports.
*   **Security:** Offers superior security compared to manual systems, permitting access to accounting data only to authorized users.

## D. Requirements of Computerized Accounting
The basic requirements are:
1.  **Accounting Framework:** Requires a healthy framework defined by accounting principles, coding structure, and grouping structure.
2.  **Operating Procedure:** Needs a well-designed operating procedure blended with a suitable operating environment of the enterprise, often relying on a database-oriented application.

# III. Manual vs. Computerized Accounting

The differences between the two systems are significant, particularly in how data is handled after the initial recording:

| Basis | Manual Accounting | Computerized Accounting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recording** | Financial transactions recorded via books of original entry (Journal, etc.). | Data content is stored in a well-designed database. |
| **Classification** | Transactions are classified by posting them into the ledger accounts (data duplication occurs). | No data duplication. Stored data is processed to appear as classified reports. |
| **Summarizing** | Transactions are summarized to produce the Trial Balance by manually ascertaining account balances. | Generation of ledger accounts is **not a necessary condition** for preparing the Trial Balance. |
| **Adjusting** | Adjusting entries are manually made to adhere to the matching principle. | There is no need for manual adjusting
| **Classification** | Transactions are classified by posting them into the ledger accounts (data duplication occurs). | No data duplication. Stored data is processed to appear as classified reports. |
| **Summarizing** | Transactions are summarized to produce the Trial Balance by manually ascertaining account balances. | Generation of ledger accounts is **not a necessary condition** for preparing the Trial Balance. |
| **Adjusting** | Adjusting entries are manually made to adhere to the matching principle. | There is no need for manual adjusting entries for errors and rectifications in the system. |
| **Financial Statements** | Preparation of statements assumes the availability of a Trial Balance. | Preparation of statements is **independent** of producing the Trial Balance. |

# IV. Introduction to Tally

**Tally** is a financial accounting software package designed by Tally Solutions, primarily intended for **small and medium businesses and shops**. Tally ERP 9 is the latest version.

## A. Features and Benefits of Tally
Tally is designed to integrate and automate all business transactions. It is very simple to use and allows data entry in various formats.

Tally helps solve problems common in manual accounting, especially detecting errors. As soon as a transaction is entered in Tally, it is duly posted in the ledger and entered into the trial balance, Trading & Profit and Loss A/c, and Balance Sheet.

Key features of Tally include:
1.  **Account Maintenance:** Maintains all primary books of accounts (Cash Book and Bank Book) and registers (Purchase Register, Sales Register, Journal Registers).
2.  **Report Generation:** Maintains and generates all statements of accounts like **Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss A/c, Trial Balance**, Cash Flow, Stock Statement, and Ratio Analysis.
3.  **Receivables/Payables:** Provides complete bill-wise information of amounts receivable and payable, either party-wise or group-wise.
4.  **Flexible Reporting Dates:** Provides reports for a particular date or for any range of dates.
5.  **Bank Reconciliation:** Provides the facility of Bank Reconciliation.
6.  **Outstation Reports:** It can maintain 'Outstation Reports'.

## B. Setting Up Tally
To use Tally, you must first install the program files (Tally.ERP 9). It requires minimal hardware (e.g., Intel Pentium IV or higher processor, 256 MB RAM or more, 40 MB disk space).

### Creating a Company
The first task after installation is to **create a company**. In Tally, a "company" signifies an entity (which may be a partnership firm, an industry, or even a branch office) for which an independent set of accounts is maintained.

When creating a company, the user inputs information such as Name, Mailing Name, Address, and specifies how accounts are maintained:
*   **Accounts Only:** Maintains accounts only, with no record of inventory.
*   **Accounts with Inventory:** Records all accounts along with all inventories.

Tally also offers the option to use security control (password-based access).

### Company Info Options
The **Company Info** screen provides various options for managing the company data:
*   **Select Company:** Loads a company created earlier.
*   **Shut Company:** Allows exiting from companies not currently in use.
*   **Alter:** Allows the user to change existing company information.
*   **Split Company Data:** Splits the existing company data into two companies; the closing balance of the first becomes the opening balance of the second.
*   **Backup/Restore:** Allows taking backups onto a local hard disk or external media.

After the company is created, the user prepares the accounts by classifying the nature of accounts (personal or impersonal) and then passes **voucher entries**. Tally automatically handles the Trial Balance, Trading and P&L A/c, and Balance Sheet generation.
