Welcome! I would be delighted to teach you the basics of computer systems, drawing on the comprehensive lesson provided in the sources. The material covers how computers are organized, the physical parts (hardware), the instructions they follow (software), and the languages used to communicate with them.

## 1. Introduction to Computers

### 1.1 What is a Computer?

A computer is fundamentally a device that **transforms data into meaningful information**. Data can be anything—like marks obtained in subjects, or personal details such as name, age, weight, or height.

The major characteristics that define a computer system include high speed, accuracy, diligence, versatility, and storage capabilities.

A computer performs five essential functions:
1.  **Accept data**.
2.  **Store data**.
3.  **Process data** as desired.
4.  **Retrieve the stored data** when needed.
5.  **Print the result** in the desired format.

### 1.2 Basic Computer Organisation

The computer system is composed of different parts organized to perform a specific task. These parts fall into two major categories: **hardware** (the machine itself and its connected devices) and **software** (the programs that utilize the hardware).

The computer performs five major operations, regardless of its size or make:

| Operation | Function | Unit Responsible |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Input | The process of entering data and programs into the system. | Input Unit |
| 2. Storage | Used to hold data and instructions. | Memory Unit |
| 3. Processing | Performs calculations and comparisons required by the user. | Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) |
| 4. Output | Producing results/useful information from the data. | Output Unit |
| 5. Control | Supervising and managing all operations (input, output, processing, and storage). It decides when to start/stop receiving data and where to store it. | Control Unit (CU) |

**Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** is jointly known as the combination of the **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** and the **Control Unit (CU)**. You can consider the CPU to be the **brain of the computer system**.

## 2. Hardware: Peripheral Devices

Peripheral devices are components connected to the computer externally to perform specific functions. These include Input Devices, Output Devices, and other peripherals.

### 2.1 Input Devices

Input devices accept data and instructions from the user.

| Input Device | Function/Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Keyboard** | The most common input device. The standard **QWERTY board** usually has 104 keys. |
| **Mouse** | An electro-mechanical, hand-held device used as a pointer. It allows for "Point and Click" actions to select commands and start programs, often replacing complex key combinations. Modern mice are typically Optical or laser. |
| **Light Pen** | Uses a light-sensitive detector to select objects directly on the display screen, similar to a mouse. |
| **Optical Scanner** | Used for **automatic data collection**, eliminating manual input. Examples include the bar-code reader and the **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** device, which banks use to convert scanned images into editable text. |
| **Touch Screen** | Displays and pads that accept input by users touching electronic buttons directly on the monitor screen. |
| **Microphone** | An input device that takes **voice as input**. It comes in desktop and hand-held forms, though voice communication is generally more error-prone than keyboard input. |
| **Track Ball** | A stationary pointing device, essentially a mouse lying on its back. The user rotates the ball with their thumb, fingers, or palm to move the pointer. Because it is stationary, it is popular for portable computers as it requires less space. |

### 2.2 Output Devices

Output devices return processed data—which is now useful information—back to the user.

#### Monitor (Visual Display Unit)
The monitor is perhaps the most important output device because people interact with it most intensively. Information processed by the CPU is sent to a video adapter, which converts the information for visual display.

There are two basic types of monitors used with microcomputers:
1.  **CRT (Cathode Ray Tube):** This is the typical, large monitor seen on a desktop computer; it works similarly to a television screen.
2.  **LCD (Liquid Crystal Displays):** Also known as flat panel monitors, these are very popular today.

The capability of a monitor is often measured by its **resolution**, which is defined in pixels (e.g., 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768).

#### Printers
Printers produce a **hard copy** (printout) of a document created on the computer.

| Printer Type | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Laser Printer** | Produces high-quality print, often used for publishing-quality output. They are extremely fast and quiet, printing up to 200 pages per minute (monochrome). |
| **Ink-Jet Printer** | Creates an image by spraying ink through tiny nozzles. The quality is high, though generally not as sharp as a laser printer. It offers an excellent middle ground, being quiet and convenient, but not particularly fast. |
| **Dot Matrix Printer** | An inexpensive and versatile device where the print head physically "hits" the paper through a ribbon, forming characters using a combination of dots. Its speed is measured in **Characters Per Second (CPS)**. It is louder, slower, and produces lower print quality compared to ink-jet and laser printers. |
| **Line Printer** | High-speed printers (100 to 3800 lines per minute) generally used with large computer systems to produce text-based reports. |

#### Other Output Devices
*   **Plotter:** A special output device designed to produce **large drawings or images**, such as construction plans or blueprints. Plotters use a robotic arm and colored pens to draw lines based on coordinate instructions from the computer. They come in two designs: **Flat Bed** (small, restricted paper size) and **Drum** (big size, using rolls of paper of unlimited length).
*   **Speakers:** Output devices that allow you to listen to voice, music, and conversations.

## 3. Software

A computer cannot function by itself; it requires instructions from the user. A **Program** is a set of instructions given in a particular sequence. **Software** refers to a set of programs that enables the hardware to perform a specific set of tasks.

Software is mainly classified into two categories: **System Software** and **Application Software**.

### 3.1 System Software
System software consists of programs responsible for running the computer, controlling operations, and managing computer resources.

*   **Operating System (OS):** This system software activates different units of the computer when you switch it on. The OS provides an interface for the user to communicate with the machine, manages hardware devices (like the keyboard and monitor), maintains file systems, and supports application programs. Popular examples include UNIX, Windows, and Linux.
*   **Utilities:** These programs bridge the gap between the features provided by the OS and the specialized needs of users. Examples include anti-virus software or compress/uncompress (zip/unzip) files software.

### 3.2 Application Software
Application software is a set of programs written to perform **specific tasks**. For instance, a "library information system" manages book details and accounts.

Application software is broadly classified into two types:

1.  **Generalized Packages:** These are user-friendly programs that cater to very general user needs, such as drawing pictures, preparing documents, or playing games.
    *   Examples include: Word Processing Software (MS-Word), Spreadsheets (MS-Excel), Presentations (MS-PowerPoint), and Graphics Tools (Adobe Photoshop).
2.  **Customized Packages:** These applications are specifically developed (or customized) to meet the unique requirements of a particular organization or institution.
    *   Examples include: Payroll packages, inventory control systems, or student information details systems.

## 4. Computer Languages and Translators

Languages serve as a means of communication between the user and the computer. Every computer language is governed by rules known as **SYNTAX**.

Computer languages are broadly classified into Low Level Languages and High Level Languages.

### 4.1 Low Level Language
Low level languages are "close to the way in which the machine understands".

*   **Machine Language:** This is the language understood directly by the computer, consisting of **0’s and 1’s (binary numbers)**. It is machine dependent and very difficult to learn and write programs in.
*   **Assembly Language:** This language uses **symbolic codes (mnemonics)** to substitute the 0’s and 1’s of machine code, making programming simpler and less time-consuming than machine language. However, it is still machine dependent.

### 4.2 High Level Language
These languages were developed to overcome the limitations of low level languages. They use **normal English-like, easy-to-understand statements** to solve problems. Higher level languages are generally **computer independent**, making programming simple and easy.

*   Examples include: **FORTRAN** (developed for scientific and mathematical problems), **COBOL** (standardized for commercial applications), **BASIC**, **C** (a structured programming language), and **C++** (a popular object oriented programming language).

### 4.3 Compilers and Assemblers (Translators)
Since High Level languages and Assembly languages are not directly understandable by the machine, **Compilers** and **Assemblers** are required to convert these instructions into machine language.

*   **Compiler:** This software reads a program written in a high level language (called the **Source Program**) and translates the entire program into an equivalent program in machine language (called the **Object Program**).
*   **Assembler:** This software reads a program written in assembly language (Source Program) and translates it into an equivalent program in machine language (Object Program).
