I'm delighted to continue our detailed lessons! Based on the source material, this instruction focuses entirely on **Formatting Worksheets in MS Excel 2007**. Formatting gives your worksheet a polished look and helps the viewer understand its purpose more easily.

## 1. Introduction to Formatting Worksheets

Formatting features in MS Excel allow you to change the size, colour, and angle of fonts, add colour to the borders and backgrounds of cells, and even have a cell's format change based on its value. You will find that some of these formatting features are similar to those you used in MS Word.

The primary locations where Excel 2007 formatting tools are available are:
1.  In the **Home tab** of the Ribbon.
2.  In the **mini toolbar** that appears when you right-click a cell or a range.
3.  In the **Format Cells dialog box**.

### 1.1 Home Tab and Formatting Tools

The **Home tab** provides quick access to the most commonly used options for formatting. After selecting a cell or a range, you can use tools organized into groups like **Font**, **Alignment**, or **Number**. Some controls are expandable, displaying available choices when you click a small arrow next to a button (known as a **dialog box launcher** in the Ribbon).

### 1.2 The Mini Toolbar

When you right-click a cell or a range selection, a **Shortcut Menu** appears, and a **mini toolbar** is displayed above it. This mini toolbar contains controls for common formatting tasks, including:
*   Font type and size
*   Bold, Italic, and Center alignment
*   Font Color and Fill Color
*   Borders
*   Merge And Center
*   Accounting Number Format, Comma Style, Percent Style
*   Increase/Decrease Font, and Increase/Decrease Decimal
*   Format Painter

### 1.3 The Format Cells Dialog Box

While the Home tab handles most formatting needs, the **Format Cells dialog box** is used for special types of formatting. This dialog box allows you to apply nearly any type of formatting style and number formatting. The formats selected will be applied to the cells that are selected at that time.

**To access the Format Cells dialog box, follow these methods**:
*   Press the key combination **Ctrl+1** (Control key and numeric 1 key).
*   Click the **dialog box launcher** (a small downward-pointing arrow icon) in the Home $\rightarrow$ Font, Home $\rightarrow$ Alignment, or Home $\rightarrow$ Number groups on the Ribbon.
*   Right-click the selected cell or range and choose **Format Cells** from the shortcut menu.
*   Click the **More command** in some drop-down controls in the Ribbon (e.g., Home $\rightarrow$ Number $\rightarrow$ General $\rightarrow$ More Number Formats).

The Format Cells dialog box has **six tabs**: **Number, Alignment, Font, Border, Patterns, and Protection**.

## 2. Formatting Cells Using the Dialog Box

### 2.1 Number Tab

The **Number tab** allows you to select the data type for the cell contents.
*   You select the range you want to format, then click one of the **Category** options to apply that style.
*   Select **General** if the cell contains text and numbers and does not have any specific number format.
*   If you select the **Number Category**, you can represent numbers as integers or decimals and specify the number of **decimal places** (e.g., restrict decimals to 2).
*   For dates and times, you select **Date** or **Time** from the Category box and choose the required format from the **Type** box. Excel automatically recognizes text like "January 1, 2001" as a date and converts the format (e.g., to "1-Jan-01").

### 2.2 Alignment Tab

The **Alignment tab** controls the position and alignment of data within the cell. The Format Cells dialog box provides **more options** than the alignment buttons on the Formatting toolbar, such as the ability to change the **orientation** of the text.

### 2.3 Font Tab

The **Font tab** displays all font attributes, including **font face, size, style, and effects**. While the Formatting toolbar allows you to bold, italicize, and underline, you use the Format Cells dialog box for even more font formatting options.

### 2.4 Border and Pattern Tabs

You can add borders, cell shading, and font colour using the Formatting toolbar, which uses **tear-off palettes**. However, for detailed control over borders and patterns, use the dialog box tabs.

**To apply a border and colour using the Format Cells dialog box**:
1.  Go to the **Border tab**.
2.  In the **Presets area**, choose **None, Outline, or Inside** to specify the border location.
3.  Choose the border's **line style** in the **Style area** and select a **colour** if necessary.
4.  Go to the **Patterns tab**.
5.  Select a colour for the cell **background** in the **Color palette**.
6.  If needed, select a **pattern** for the background in the Pattern palette.
7.  Click **OK** to apply the border and colour.

## 3. Formatting Columns and Rows

### 3.1 AutoFit Feature (Resizing)

If the contents of columns or rows do not fit their current size, you can use the **AutoFit** feature to adjust the width or height automatically.

**Steps to AutoFit Column Width**:
1.  Click on the Column Header (or any cell in the column).
2.  Click the **Home tab**.
3.  Select **Format** from the **Cells group** on the Ribbon.
4.  Click on **AutoFit Column Width**.

You can apply the same procedure to rows by selecting the row header and clicking **AutoFit Row Height**.

### 3.2 Best Fit Method (Mouse Adjustment)

Another way to automatically adjust columns and rows is through the "best fit" method using the mouse:
1.  Place your pointer on or near the right edge of a column header. The pointer changes to a **double-headed arrow**.
2.  **Double-click** the pointer, and the column to the left will automatically adjust its width to fit the data entries within it.
3.  Similarly, double-clicking the boundary of a row header adjusts the row height to a best fit.

### 3.3 Hiding and Unhiding Columns and Rows

Hiding columns or rows prevents unwanted changes while the data remains present.

**To hide a column**:
1.  Select the column by clicking on the column header.
2.  **Right-click** on the Column and click on the **Hide** option.

**To unhide a column**:
1.  Select the **visible range of columns** that includes the hidden column(s) (e.g., columns B and D if C is hidden).
2.  **Right-click** on the selected columns.
3.  Select **Unhide** from the pop-up menu.

You can follow the same procedures to Hide and Unhide rows.

## 4. Applying Styles and AutoFormat

### 4.1 Cell Styles

Excel 2007 provides **cell styles** to quickly format a cell by choosing from predefined options, which helps give worksheets a professional look. In Excel, all styles are cell styles, though a defined style can be applied to an entire worksheet.

**Common predefined style effects include**:
1.  **Comma:** Adds commas to the number and two decimal digits.
2.  **Currency:** Formats the number as currency with a dollar sign, commas, and two decimal digits.
3.  **Percent:** Changes the number to a percent and adds a percent sign.
4.  **Normal:** Reverts any changes to general number format.

**To apply a style**:
1.  Select the cells.
2.  Choose the **Home tab**.
3.  From the **Styles group**, click on **Cell Styles** (e.g., choosing Heading1).

**To delete a style**:
1.  **Right-click** on the style you wish to remove (e.g., Bad Style).
2.  Choose **delete**.

### 4.2 Format Painter

The **Format Painter** is a handy feature for copying complex formatting (like font style, number format, date format, and borders) from one cell to another cell or group of cells.

**To use Format Painter**:
1.  Place the cursor within the cell containing the desired formatting.
2.  Click the **Format Painter button** in the **Clipboard group** of the Home tab (your pointer will have a paintbrush beside it).
3.  **Highlight the cells** you want to apply the same formatting to.
*   **Tip:** To copy the formatting to *many* groups of cells, **double-click** the Format Painter button. It remains active until you press the **ESC** key.

### 4.3 AutoFormat (Format as Table)

Excelâ€™s **AutoFormat** feature uses **table styles**, which are predefined collections of number formats, fonts, cell alignments, patterns, shading, column widths, and row heights, to give specified ranges of cells a polished look.

**Steps to apply an AutoFormat (Format as Table)**:
1.  **Highlight the cells** that will be formatted.
2.  Select **Home tab $\rightarrow$ Style group $\rightarrow$ Format as Table** from the Ribbon, which shows many predefined formats.
3.  Select the desired format (e.g., selecting the fourth table format from the Dark category).
4.  In the resulting dialog box, check the **My Table has headers** checkbox and click **OK**.
*   After applying, a **Table Tools Design tab** appears on the Ribbon, allowing you to change the style further.

## 5. Hiding/Unhiding and Protecting Worksheets
