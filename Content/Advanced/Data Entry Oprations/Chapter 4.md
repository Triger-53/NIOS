I am happy to provide you with another detailed lesson, this time focusing on **Formatting Documents** using Microsoft Word 2007, covering text entry, editing, formatting, and document organization features.

***

## 1. Introduction to Document Formatting

### 1.1 What is Formatting?

Formatting refers to features that enrich a document's appearance and are Word's specialty. Word's formatting features allow you to create attractive documents often by doing little more than typing headings and text.

Word 2007 provides extensive formatting options, including:
*   Multiple typefaces (fonts) and point sizes.
*   Easy-to-apply character styles such as **bold, italic**, normal, single and double spaces, underline, subscript, and superscript.
*   Paragraph formats such as **alignment, spacing, and indentation**.

### 1.2 Objectives of Formatting

After going through this lesson, you will be able to:
*   Define basic text processing tips.
*   Explain spelling and grammar features.
*   Change character and paragraph formats.
*   Use page formatting.
*   Create bulleted and numbered lists.

***

## 2. Working with Text: Entry and Editing

### 2.1 Typing Text

To enter text, simply start typing in the text area where the blinking cursor is located.

*   **Automatic Wrapping:** Unlike a typewriter, you **do not need to press the ENTER key at the end of each line**; the text automatically wraps (moves) to the next continuous line.
*   **New Paragraph:** Press the **ENTER key** only when you are ready to start a new paragraph.

### 2.2 Moving the Cursor (Insertion Point)

You can move the cursor using the mouse (positioning and clicking the left button) or by using keyboard shortcuts:

| Location | Keyboard Shortcut |
| :--- | :--- |
| Beginning of the line | **HOME** |
| End of the line | **END** |
| Top of the document | **CTRL+HOME** |
| End of the document | **CTRL+END** |

### 2.3 Inserting and Replacing Text

*   **Inserting Text:** Move the cursor to the desired insertion point and simply start typing the new text.
*   **Replacing Text:** Word can combine deleting and inserting. To replace text, first **select (highlight)** the text to be removed, and then **start typing the new text**; the selected text will be automatically replaced.

### 2.4 Using Spacebar and Tabs

*   Use the **spacebar** as a separator between words and sentences.
*   **Avoid using the spacebar to move the insertion point** across a line of text ("spacing across a line") or to create columns of text, as this creates additional spaces you would later have to delete. Instead, use the **Tab key** to move across a line or create columns.

### 2.5 Deleting Text

*   **BACKSPACE** key deletes the text to the **left** of the cursor.
*   **DELETE** key deletes the text to the **right** of the cursor.
*   To delete a large selection, **highlight** the text first and then press the **DELETE** key.

### 2.6 Selecting (Highlighting) Text

To change any attribute of text, it must first be highlighted.

| Selection | Method |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Whole word** | **Double-click** within the word |
| **Whole paragraph** | **Triple-click** within the paragraph |
| Several words or lines | Drag the mouse over the words, OR hold down **SHIFT** key while using the arrow keys |
| **Entire document** | Press **CTRL+A** keys, OR choose Edit→Select All command |

To deselect text, click anywhere outside of the selection or press an arrow key on the keyboard.

### 2.7 Special Text Features

*   **Paragraph Markers:** To make typing easier, you can display returns, spaces, and tabs by clicking the **Show/Hide** ($\pi$) button on the Standard toolbar (and click it again to hide them).
*   **Click and Type:** This feature allows you to insert text anywhere on a page by **moving the cursor to the desired spot, double-clicking, and starting to type**. It is also useful for inserting tables, charts, and graphics in blank areas.

***

## 3. Formatting Text and Characters

The easiest way to change text attributes is by using the **Home Tab** and selecting desired commands under the **Font** and **Paragraph** subtasks.

### 3.1 Font Formatting

*   **Font Face:** The basic typeface (e.g., Times New Roman or Ariel). Click the arrowhead next to the font name box to view the list of available fonts.
*   **Font Size:** Measured in **points** (where 1 point = 1/72 of an inch). A size of 10 or 12 points is generally best for paragraphs.
*   **Font Style:** Determines the emphasis (e.g., **bold**, *italicize*, and underline).
*   **Text Color & Highlight:** You can change the color of the text (Text Color) or the color behind the text selection (Highlight Color).

### 3.2 Format Painter

The **Format Painter** (located on the Home Tab under the Clipboard subtask) is a useful feature for copying formatting (like font face, size, and style) from one section of text to another.

**To use Format Painter:**
1.  Place the cursor within the text containing the desired formatting.
2.  **Click the Format Painter button**. Your pointer will gain a paintbrush icon.
3.  **Highlight the text** you want to format and release the mouse button.
*   **For multiple selections:** **Double-click** the Format Painter button. It remains active until you press the **ESC** key.

### 3.3 Text Alignment

Text can be aligned in four ways:
*   Left alignment (default).
*   Center alignment.
*   Right alignment.
*   Justified (spread evenly across the page).

***

## 4. Paragraph Formatting

In Word 2007, a paragraph is defined as any text or item followed by a **paragraph mark**, which is inserted every time the **ENTER** key is pressed. Paragraph formats affect the entire paragraph.

You can format a paragraph by placing the cursor within it and selecting **Home → Paragraph subtask menu**.

### 4.1 Line Markers

To insert a new line within the **same paragraph** (without creating a new paragraph mark), press **SHIFT+ENTER** keys.

### 4.2 Indenting Text

Indenting sets a paragraph off from other text:
*   You can drag the top half of the triangular indent marker on the horizontal ruler to indent automatically.
*   Use the **Increase Indent** or **Decrease Indent** buttons on the Formatting toolbar to change indents by one Tab stop.
*   A **hanging indent** indents all lines *except* the first line of a paragraph.

### 4.3 Line Spacing

Line spacing determines the height of each line of text.

*   The default is **single line spacing**.
*   Line spacing options like single, one-and-a-half, and double spacing can be selected from the **Paragraph dialog box** (found under Home → Paragraphs subtask).
*   Example spacing: Single spacing is 12-point; 1½ spacing is 18 points; Double spacing is 24 points apart.

### 4.4 Paragraph Spacing

Word allows unique **Before** and **After** spacing for each paragraph, which is useful for headings or figure captions.

**Advantages of using Paragraph Spacing:**
1.  Spacing before and after paragraphs **does not change the point size** of your text.
2.  The spacing stays with the paragraph if it is moved or deleted, preventing extra blank lines.
3.  You can use different spacing combinations for clarity (e.g., between headings and body text).

### 4.5 Borders and Shading

You can add borders to any side of a paragraph or add background shading.
1.  Choose **Home → Paragraphs subtask menu** and click the Border button to display the **Borders and Shading** dialog box.
2.  In the Borders tab, select the border style and choose **Paragraph** under the *Apply to* menu.
3.  In the Shading tab, select a shade under *Fill* and choose **Paragraph** under the *Apply to* menu.

### 4.6 Tab Stops

By default, tab stops are set at **0.5-inch intervals** from the left margin.

*   Pressing the **Tab key** moves the insertion point to the next tab stop.
*   You can change the tab length using the Tabs dialog box (Home → Paragraphs subtask → Tabs button).
*   You can set specific tab alignments (Left-aligned, Centred, Right-aligned, Decimal) by clicking the **Tab Alignment button** on the far left of the horizontal ruler.

## 5. Working with Lists

Bulleted and Numbered lists are used to draw attention to main points.

### 5.1 Creating Lists

1.  Click the **Bulleted List button** or **Numbered List button** on the formatting toolbar (under the Home Tab).
2.  Type the entry and press **ENTER** (which creates a new bullet/number).
3.  Press **ENTER twice** when finished to end the list.
*   To start a new line *without* adding a bullet or number, hold down **SHIFT** while pressing **ENTER**.
*   You can also type text first, highlight it, and then click the list button.

### 5.2 Nested Lists

To create a nested list (e.g., a numbered list inside a bulleted list Tab).
2.  Type the entry and press **ENTER** (which creates a new bullet/number).
3.  Press **ENTER twice** when finished to end the list.
*   To start a new line *without* adding a bullet or number, hold down **SHIFT** while pressing **ENTER**.
*   You can also type text first, highlight it, and then click the list button.

### 5.2 Nested Lists

To create a nested list (e.g., a numbered list inside a bulleted list):
1.  Type the list items.
2.  Increase the indentation of the inner list items by clicking the **Increase Indent button** for each item.
3.  Highlight the nested items and click the **Numbered List button** (or the desired list button).

### 5.3 Formatting Lists

To change the bullet image or numbering format, use the **Bullets and Numbering dialog box** (accessed via Home → Paragraphs subtask menu, or by right-clicking the list).

## 6. Copying and Moving Text

Both copying and moving text utilize the **Clipboard**.

### 6.1 The Clipboard

When you copy or cut text, it is stored in the memory area called the **clipboard**.
*   The last **12 elements** that were cut or copied are placed onto Word’s clipboard.
*   You can view the clipboard elements by selecting **Home → Clipboard sub task menu**.

### 6.2 Moving (Cutting) Text

Moving text means removing selected text from one location and inserting it in another.

1.  **Select** the text to be moved.
2.  **Cut:** Select **Home → Clipboard sub task menu** OR click the **Cut button** OR press **CTRL+X**. (This moves the text to the clipboard).
3.  **Paste:** Move the cursor to the new location, then select **Home → Clipboard sub task menu** OR click the **Paste button** OR press **CTRL+V**.

*   **Drag-and-Drop:** For moving a small amount of text a short distance, you can highlight the text, click the selection, drag it to the new location, and release the mouse button.

### 6.3 Copying Text

Copying creates a copy of the selected text in another location, leaving the original text unchanged.

1.  **Select** the text to be copied.
2.  **Copy:** Choose **Home → Clipboard sub task menu** OR click the **Copy button** OR press **CTRL+C**. (This copies the text to the clipboard).
3.  **Paste:** Move the cursor to the new location and paste the text using **CTRL+V** or the Paste button.
*Note: The keyboard shortcut CTRL+C for copying and the menu command 'Copy' are the same action.*

## 7. Spelling and Grammar Correction

Word automatically checks for spelling and grammar errors unless you turn this feature off.

*   **Red wavy lines** appear underneath misspelled words.
*   **Green wavy lines** appear underneath grammatical errors.

### 7.1 Using the Checker

1.  Start the checker by selecting the relevant button from the main tab bar OR by pressing the **F7** key.
2.  The Spelling and Grammar dialog box will highlight the first mistake.
3.  **If the word is correct:** Click **Ignore** (or **Ignore All** if it appears often).
4.  **If the word is incorrect:**
    *   Choose a spelling from the **Suggestions box** and click **Change** (or **Change All**).
    *   If the correct spelling isn't suggested, type it into the **Not In Dictionary box** and click **Change**.
    *   If the word is correct and will be used often (like your name), click **Add** to add it to the dictionary.

### 7.2 Grammar Checking

If the **Check Grammar box** is checked, Word will check grammar alongside spelling.
1.  Grammar mistakes are highlighted in **green text**.
2.  Select the best correction from the **Suggestions box** and click **Change**.
3.  If no correction is needed (as Word can sometimes be wrong), click **Ignore**.
