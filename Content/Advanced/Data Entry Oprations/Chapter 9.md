## 1. Introduction to Presentations

### 1.1 What is a Presentation?

A presentation occurs whenever you appear in front of one or more people to communicate your ideas, deliver a speech, give a classroom lecture, or organize a computer conference.

The basic purpose of any presentation is **communication**. To communicate effectively, you must state your facts in a **simple, concise, and interesting manner**.

Any presentation consists of four basic elements:
1.  **You**.
2.  Your **audience**.
3.  Your **message**.
4.  Your **tools**.

### 1.2 Microsoft PowerPoint 2007

**Microsoft PowerPoint 2007** is a complete presentation software that helps you create slides and present exciting slide shows, even if you are not a multimedia expert. PowerPoint provides helpful suggestions on the **layout, design, and formats** of your slides.

### 1.3 Main Features of PowerPoint

PowerPoint offers several ways to create a presentation and enhances your presentations with pictures, sound effects, tables, and charts.

1.  **Slide Creation:** Creating slides is the root of all work in PowerPoint. You can communicate your ideas across with a series of slides.
2.  **Adding Text:** Adding text helps you put your ideas into words.
3.  **Multimedia Features:** These features make your slides "sparkle." You can add **clip art, sound effects, music, and video clips**.
4.  **Presentation Preparation:** Preparing a presentation is easy. Once slides are created, you can put them in order, time your slide show, and present them to your audience.

## 2. Starting and Understanding the PowerPoint Screen

### 2.1 Starting the Program

One common way to start your PowerPoint program is using the Start button:
1.  Click on the **Start button**.
2.  In the menu that appears, select **All Programs $\rightarrow$ Microsoft Office $\rightarrow$ Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007**.
3.  The PowerPoint screen will appear on the monitor shortly.

### 2.2 Key Screen Elements

When you start PowerPoint, you see a **Blank presentation**.

*   **Office Button:** In PowerPoint 2007, the **Office button** replaces the File menu found in other programs.
*   **Ribbon:** The bar below the title bar is known as the **Ribbon** (which replaces the Menu and Tool bars of some older programs).
    *   The Ribbon consists of a number of **Tabs** (Home, Insert, etc.) designed to be **task oriented**.
    *   **Groups** within each Tab break a task into **subtasks**.
    *   **Command buttons** in each group carry out a command or display a menu of commands.

## 3. Creating Presentations

PowerPoint offers multiple ways to begin creating a presentation.

### 3.1 Using Installed Templates

Installed templates provide ready-made designs and ideas for a variety of presentation types.
1.  Go to the **Office button** and click **New**.
2.  Select the **Installed templates** tab.
3.  Select the desired template.
4.  Move through the wizard by clicking the scroll-bar or the down arrow button after making necessary choices.
5.  Choose the type of presentation you like and click on **Create** when finished.

### 3.3 Blank Presentations

You can choose the **Blank Presentation** option to start a new presentation from scratch. This is useful if you have a new approach or if none of the templates suit your needs.

### 3.4 Slide Layouts

Once you choose a form for your new presentation, the first slide appears. You can **right-click** on the slide to choose the layout you want.

There are **nine different slide layouts** from which to choose:

| Layout Type | Description/Use |

PowerPoint provides multiple views to aid in creation and presentation. You can access these views by clicking the respective **view buttons** at the bottom right of the PowerPoint window, or by selecting the view command under the **View** menu bar.

### 4.1 Normal View

This is where you will do **most of your work**. The screen is divided into three sections:

2.  The **outline pane** on the left.
3.  The **notes pane** at the bottom.
You can resize each pane by clicking its border and dragging it. To access it, click the **Normal view button** or select **View $\rightarrow$ Normal** command.

### 4.2 Slide Sorter View

This view displays a **small image of each slide**.

*   To access, click the **Slide Sorter view button** or select **View $\rightarrow$ Slide Sorter** command.

### 4.3 Slide Show View

This is the view to use when you **preview your presentation** or when you **deliver it to an audience**.

## 5. Working with Slides (Organization and Design)

### 5.1 Working with Slides (Organization and Design)

### 5.2 Inserting and Editing Slides

Slides can be inserted, edited from other files, cut/copied/pasted, and duplicated.

*   **Duplicating Slides:** To create a copy of the current slide, choose the slide, right-click and select **Duplicate Slide**, or press **CTRL+SHIFT+D**.
*   **Slides from Outline:** This feature creates slides from text file outlines, useful when creating a group of slides that contain a lot of text. To access the feature, select **Home $\rightarrow$ New Slide $\rightarrow$ Slides from Outline**. You can also create new slides by typing text in the outline pane.

### 5.3 Reordering and Hiding Slides

*   **Reordering Slides:** In **Slide Sorter View**, click on the slide you wish to move and drag it to the new location. In **Normal or Outline View**, click on the slide in the slide pane and drag it to the new location.
*   **Hide Slides:** If you do not want a slide to appear during the slide show but do not want to delete it, you can hide it by **right-clicking** on the slide in the slide pane and selecting **Hide**. A hidden slide can be unhidden in the same manner.

### 5.4 Moving Between Slides

You can move from one slide to another using:
1.  **Scroll Bars:** Use the vertical scroll bars to move between slides or through the text in the notes pane and outline pane.
2.  **Next Slide and Previous Slide Buttons:** Located at the bottom of the vertical scroll bar (indicated by a double-arrow), these buttons move you to the next or previous slide.
3.  **Outline Pane:** Change to Outline view and click on the slide you want to view. You can use the mouse or up and down arrow keys to move around in the outline pane.

## 6. Working with Text

PowerPoint provides several ways to insert, edit, and format text.

### 6.1 Inserting Text

Text can be inserted using outlining or text boxes.

*   **Outline Text:** Outline text creates slides of a similar nature. Heading 1 becomes the slide title, Heading 2 becomes the first line of the text box, and so on.
*   **Text Boxes:** Text boxes are how PowerPoint puts text on a slide. When you use a specific slide layout, the slide will have one or more text boxes.
    *   **Adding New Text Box:** Select **Insert $\rightarrow$ Text Box** command, and then draw the text box with the mouse where you want to insert it.
    *   **Resizing Text Box:** Select the text box (a border with eight handles appears). Drag one of the corner handles to resize length and width simultaneously, or drag side handles to resize in one direction.
    *   **Moving Text Box:** Click and drag the thick dotted border.
    *   **Deleting Text Box:** Click the border of the text box, then press the **DELETE** key.

### 6.2 Formatting Text (Fonts, Spacing, Case)

*   **Format Fonts:** Select the text, then select **Home $\rightarrow$ Font** or right-click the selection and choose **Font** from the shortcut menu. Here, you can select font face, size, style, effect, and colour.
*   **Replace Fonts:** To change a font across the entire presentation, select **Home $\rightarrow$ Replace $\rightarrow$ Replace Fonts**. Choose the font to replace and the font to replace it with, and click **Replace**.
*   **Line Spacing:** Change the vertical space between lines by selecting **Home $\rightarrow$ Line Spacing** from the Paragraph menu bar. A value of "1" is single spacing, and "2" is double spacing.
*   **Change Case:** Select **Home $\rightarrow$ Change Case** to change text case without retyping:
    *   *Sentence case* (capitalizes first letter of first word).
    *   *Lowercase and Uppercase* (changes all letters).
    *   *Title case* (capitalizes the first letter of every word).
    *   *Toggle case* (opposite of Title case).

### 6.3 Bulleted and Numbered Lists

Bulleted lists allow you to clearly display the main points of your presentation.

*   **Bulleted Lists (Design Templates):** Text boxes on design templates already include bulleted lists. Press **ENTER** to create a new bulleted item. Hold down **SHIFT** while pressing **ENTER** to go to the next line without adding a new bullet.
*   **Creating Numbered Lists:** With the text box selected, choose **Home $\rightarrow$ Paragraph $\rightarrow$ Numbering**. You can change the size, colour, and starting value for the numbering.
*   **Outline View for Lists:** In Normal or Outline view, pressing the **TAB key** or **ALT+SHIFT+Right Arrow** keys demotes text to a bulleted list item. Pressing **ALT+SHIFT+Left Arrow** keys returns you to the original list.

### 6.4 Text Box Properties

The **Format Shape dialog box** allows you to change the colours, borders, and backgrounds of a text box.

1.  Select the text box, then select **Format Shape** command.
2.  Use the **Fill menu** to choose a background colour (with an option for Semitransparent so the slide background shows through).
3.  Use **Line Color** for the border, **Line Style** for thickness/style, and **Dashed** property if the line shouldn't be solid.
4.  Use **Shadow** for preset shadow styles, and **3D Format/3D Rotation** for 3D effects.
5.  Use the **Text Box tab** to reposition the text within the text box.

### 6.5 Adding Notes

From **Normal View**, you can add notes to a slide. These notes are **not seen** during the presentation but can be printed out with the slide by selecting **Print What: Notes Pages** on the Print menu.

### 6.6 Spell Check

PowerPoint helps ensure text accuracy using the spell checker.

1.  Start the spell check by selecting **Review $\rightarrow$ Spelling** command or pressing the **F7** key.
2.  If the word is correct, click **Ignore** or **Ignore All**. If it will appear in many presentations (like your name), click **Add** to add it to the dictionary.
3.  If misspelled, highlight a suggestion or type your own revision in the *Change to* box, and click **Change** or **Change All**.
