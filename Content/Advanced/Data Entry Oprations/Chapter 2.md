This lesson will introduce you to the fundamental concepts and functions of a computer's **Operating System (OS)**, specifically focusing on the features and elements of **Windows XP** as detailed in the sources.

## 1. Introduction to the Operating System

### 1.1 What is an Operating System?

The operating system (OS) is crucial software that manages the computer's resources and provides an interface for the user. Modern operating systems use a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

The main advantage of a GUI is that **you do not have to remember all the commands by heart**. Instead, the commands are visible on the monitor as icons.

### 1.2 The Windows OS

The most popular operating system available today is **‘Windows’**. This system has evolved over time, starting with versions like Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 2000. Currently, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 are or have been in use. This lesson focuses on the main features of Windows XP.

*   When a program or window is closed, its icon disappears from the task bar.

### 2.3 Start Menu

When you click on the **Start button**, a menu appears on the screen, providing all the available options to begin using Windows.

Key options available in the Start Menu include:

File management, which includes operations like copying, moving, and renaming files, can be performed using **Windows Explorer** or **My Computer**.

**Windows Explorer** displays a **hierarchical list** of files, folders, and storage drives on your computer, including any network drives mapped to drive letters.

#### 4.3.1 Creating, Renaming, and Deleting Files/Folders

*   **Creating a new folder:**
    1.  Click on Start, then My Documents.
    2.  Under the **File** menu, click **New** and select **Folder**.
    3.  Type the new name for the folder and press **ENTER**.

*   **Renaming a file or folder:**
    1.  Click on Start, then My Documents.

*   **Permanent Deletion:** Files deleted from removable storage media (like a network drive) are **permanently deleted** and bypass the Recycle Bin. You can also permanently delete a file from the hard disk by pressing and holding down the **SHIFT** key while dragging the file to the Recycle Bin.

#### 4.3.3 Copying and Moving Files

One way to copy a file is to **drag and drop** the file to the target folder or drive.

When using Windows Explorer to drag an item:
*   If you drag an item to **another disk**, it is **copied**, not moved. To move the item in this case, you must press and hold down **SHIFT** while dragging.
*   If you drag an item to a new location while pressing the **right mouse button**, you are given options to move, copy, or create a shortcut.
*   To copy an item instead of moving it (e.g., within the same disk), press and hold down **CTRL** while dragging.

To copy or move a file using the **My Documents** window:
1.  Click on the file or folder to be copied (you can select non-consecutive files by holding down the **CTRL key** while clicking them).
