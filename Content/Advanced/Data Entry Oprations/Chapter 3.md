That's an excellent request! Continuing our detailed instruction, this lesson focuses on **Word Processing**, specifically using **MS Word 2007** as described in the sources. We will cover what word processing is, its main features, the components of the Word screen, and how to manage documents.

***

## 1. Basics of Word Processing

### 1.1 What is Word Processing?

**Word processing** is an application program that allows you to create various types of documents, such as letters, reports, newsletters, tables, form letters, brochures, and Web pages. Using word processing software, you can also enhance your documents by adding pictures, tables, and charts, and you can even check spelling and grammar.

### 1.2 Main Features of Word Processing

Word processing software offers numerous features to create professional documents efficiently:

*   **Templates:** You can create professional documents fast using built-in and custom templates.
*   **Large Document Management:** It allows you to easily manage large documents through features like creating a **table of contents, index, and cross-references**.
*   **Multiple Documents:** You can **work on multiple documents simultaneously**.
*   **Mail Merge:** This feature allows you to quickly create merge documents, such as **mass mailings or mailing labels**.
*   **AutoCorrect and AutoFormat:** These features automatically catch typographical errors and allow you to use predefined shortcuts and typing patterns to quickly format documents.
*   **Print Zoom:** This facility scales a document on different paper sizes and allows you to **print out multiple pages on a single sheet of paper**.
*   **Nested Tables:** Word processing supports putting **one table inside another table**.
*   **Export Formats:** You can export and save your word documents in **PDF (Portable Document Format) and XPS (XML Paper Specification) file formats**.

### 1.3 Key Features of MS Word 2007

MS Word 2007 introduced useful features and tools to produce professional documents.

*   **MS Office Fluent User Interface:** Word 2007 uses this concept, which incorporates a new component called the **Ribbon**.
*   **Ribbon Organization:** The Ribbon groups tools by task, within tasks by subtasks, and includes related commands used frequently. The interface presents tools in an organized and efficient manner, making them easy to locate. Tabs (like Home, Insert, Page Layout) are more task-oriented, and related sub-tasks and command buttons are grouped within each tab.
*   **Pre-formatted Templates:** Word 2007 provides many pre-formatted templates, allowing you to select available **cover pages, headers, and footers** to give documents a professional look without spending much time on formatting.
*   **Graphics and Effects:** It offers features for creating charts and diagrams, including **three-dimensional shapes, transparency, drop shadows, and other effects**, which help in representing data efficiently.
*   **Digital Signature:** You can ensure the **authenticity, integrity, and origin of a document** by adding an invisible digital signature or inserting a visible Microsoft Office Signature Line.
*   **"Mark As Final":** Before sharing a final document, you can use the **"Mark As Final"** feature to protect it from changes. This command makes the document **"read-only,"** disabling typing, editing, and proofing commands. However, note that "Mark As Final" is a security feature that anyone can turn off to edit the document.

## 2. Starting and Understanding the Word Screen

### 2.1 Starting MS Word Program

One common way to start Word 2007 is using the Start button:

1.  Click on the **Start button**.
2.  In the menu that appears, select **All Programs → Microsoft Office → Microsoft Office Word 2007**.
3.  The Word screen will appear on the monitor shortly.

You can also start MS Word by **double-clicking on the Microsoft Word icon** if it is on the Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar (MOSB).

### 2.2 Word Screen Layout

The Word screen (Window) contains several objects, including Tabs, Menus, Sub menus, and shortcut commands.

#### 2.2.1 Menus and Tabs
Word 2007 features display as various **tabs** such, as Home, Insert, Page Layout, References, etc.. To view all sub tasks/options within a tab, you must click the required option.

*   **Shortcut Menus:** These allow you to access various Word commands faster than using the menu bar options. The options displayed vary depending on the item or sub-task that was selected. Shortcut menus are helpful because they only display options applicable to the selected item, preventing searching through many menu options.

#### 2.2.2 Toolbars
MS Word 2007 provides a customized **quick access toolbar** for easy and fast access to commands. Many toolbars with shortcut buttons are available for quicker editing and formatting. You can add or modify the tools displayed by clicking on the **“More Commands”** option.

#### 2.2.3 Rulers
The **rulers** display horizontal and vertical scales that reflect the width and height of your typing area. The **horizontal scale** is very valuable for quickly setting **tabs, margins, and indents**. You can select or deselect the Ruler/Gridlines and other options using the **View tab**.

#### 2.2.4 Typing Screen Objects
The open area below the rulers and toolbars is the **writing or typing area**. Permanent objects in this area include:

1.  **Insertion Point:** The black vertical blinking line, initially at the top left, indicates where your typing is inserted into the document. It moves as you type, and you can move it using the arrow keys or by clicking elsewhere in the text.
2.  **Mouse Pointer:** When moving the mouse in the typing area, the pointer looks like a **thin I-beam**. Near the menu bar and toolbars, it becomes a pointing arrow. Clicking the mouse places the insertion point at that spot in the text.
3.  **End-of-Document Marker:** This is a horizontal line (like a short underline) at the end of the document (visible only in Normal view), indicating the end of the document.

#### 2.2.5 Scrollbars
*   **Vertical Scrollbar:** Borders the right side of the typing area and has a scroll button and arrows. The single down arrow scrolls line by line, while the double down arrow moves to the top of the next page. You can drag the vertical scroll button to move up and down through the document.
*   **Horizontal Scrollbar:** Located along the bottom of the typing area. It allows you to see text that is off the right or left side of the screen by using the arrow buttons or dragging the scroll button. Word 2007 also provides options like document view and zoom on the bottom bar for easy access.

## 3. Managing Documents

This section covers essential file management operations within MS Word. You can access these options by clicking the **Office Button** (top left corner of the screen).

### 3.1 Creating, Opening, and Saving Documents

| Action | Menu Command (Office Button) | Keyboard Shortcut |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create a New Document** | Click the New Document button on the menu bar. | **CTRL+N**. |
| **Open an Existing Document** | Click the Open File button on the menu bar. | **CTRL+O**. |
| **Save a New/Existing Document** | Click the Save button on the menu bar. | **CTRL+S** or **SHIFT+F12**. |

**Saving Process:**
If the document is new, clicking Save (or pressing CTRL+S) prompts the **Save As dialog box**. You must select the desired folder (in the *Save In:* box), type the document name (in the *File Name:* box), and then click OK.

### 3.2 Working on Multiple Documents

You can open several documents simultaneously if you are typing or editing them concurrently. All open documents can be arranged under the **View Tab**.

### 3.3 Protecting a Document

You can protect documents from accidental changes, formatting modifications, or unauthorized access by other users.

#### Protecting from Accessing (Password)
To prevent others from opening the file, you can assign a password:
1.  With the file open, select **Office Button → Save As**.
2.  In the *Save As* dialog box, click the **Tools tab**.
3.  Click **General Options**.
4.  Type a password (up to 15 case-sensitive characters) in the **Password to open** box. Word displays asterisks (*) as you type.
5.  Click **OK**. The **Confirm Password dialog box** appears, requiring you to retype the password.
6.  Click OK on both the confirmation and Save dialog boxes.
*Remember: Passwords are case-sensitive (e.g., ‘XYZ’ and ‘xyz’ are different). You cannot open the file without the correct password.*

#### Protecting as Read Only
To prevent accidental changes to the document's format, you can recommend that it be opened as read-only.
1.  Select **Office Button → Save As**.
2.  In the *Save As* dialog box, click the **Tools tab** and then **General Options**.
3.  Check-mark (**√**) the **Read only recommended** check box.
4.  If someone tries to save changes to a read-only recommended document, they will be prompted with the message ‘This file is read-only’ and the file will not be saved.
5.  To make changes later, you must remove the check mark from the **Read only recommended** box.

#### Protecting for Track Changes and Comments
This feature allows reviewers to suggest changes or comments without modifying the original document.

*   Selecting **Track changes** (from the **Review Tab** and **Tracking** sub-task) allows other users to change the document but highlights all modifications so you can track them. While protected this way, users cannot turn off change tracking or accept/reject track changes.

### 3.4 Finding and Closing Documents

*   **Find Documents:** If you forget the file name but remember a few letters in a word that might be in the file, you can use the **Open dialog box**. Word can search by matching typed letters with the file name (the search is **not case-sensitive** for file names).
    1.  Select **Office Button → Open** command.
    2.  Select the suspected folder in the *Look in:* box.
    3.  Type letters that match part of the file name in the *File Name:* box.
*   **Close a Document:** Close the current document by selecting **Office Button → Close** command on the menu bar, or by clicking the **Close icon** on the Standard toolbar. The keyboard shortcut to close a file is **CTRL+W**.

## 4. Printing Documents

The **Print dialog box** offers several options before printing a document:

1.  Selecting the name of the printer (if multiple printers are available).
2.  Choosing paper size, orientations, resolution, etc., by pressing the **Properties button**.
3.  Printing the **entire document, only the current page, or specific pages**.
4.  Printing a **draft copy** (which omits graphics for faster printing).
5.  Setting the **number of copies**.

### 4.1 Basic Printing Steps

1.  Open the document.
2.  Choose **Office Button → Print** command. The Print dialog box opens.
3.  Select printing options (range, number of copies, printer name). Ensure the printer is switched on and paper is available.
4.  Click **OK**.
The keyboard shortcut for printing is **CTRL+P**.

### 4.2 Printing on Different Paper Sizes (Scaling)

If you need to print a document on a different paper size without disturbing the general format (or to print multiple pages on one sheet), you use the **Zoom** feature in the Print dialog box.

*   To print on a different paper size, select the appropriate paper size in **Scale to paper size:** under Zoom, and then click OK.
*   To print multiple pages on a single sheet of paper, select the appropriate number of pages in **Pages per sheet:** under Zoom, and then click OK.

## 5. Exiting Word

To quit the Word program after finishing your work and closing all files, select **Office Button → Exit** command on the menu bar.
