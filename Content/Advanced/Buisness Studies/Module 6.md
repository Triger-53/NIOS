## I. Career Planning and Choosing an Occupation

Every individual must, at some stage, choose an occupation for earning a livelihood. This process involves proper decision-making and planning, especially in today's competitive world.

### A. Concept of Career
**Career** literally means an occupation with which opportunities for **advancement or promotion** can be availed of in life.

*   **Broad Definition:** A career implies the various positions one may occupy in the course of their work-life.
*   **Progress and Actions:** It refers to the progress and actions taken by a person throughout a lifetime, especially those related to that person’s occupations.
*   **Career Path:** The work you do in different positions may be called your career path, covering a sequence of positions in a job or occupation over a person's work-life. For instance, an office assistant may eventually be promoted to office superintendent and then office manager.
*   **Changing Trends:** While employees in some cultures stay with one job, there is an increasing trend among employees to change jobs more frequently.

### B. Importance of Choosing a Career
Choosing a career is an important aspect of life, and the foundation stone of career building is laid down by this choice.

*   **Future Impact:** Career choice will probably affect an individual’s eventual life-style more than any other choice they make.

## II. Career Avenues in Business: Wage vs. Self-Employment

An individual engaged in an occupation is said to be employed, and the career objective is invariably related to an economic activity for earning a livelihood. Choosing a career involves opting for one of two alternatives:

### A. Wage Employment
**Wage employment** means serving another person for **wages or salary**.

| Basis of Distinction | Wage Employment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Status or Position** | The position of the person is that of an **employee**. |
| **Nature of Work** | Engages in activities **assigned by the employer**. The work is specific and pre-decided. |
| **Income or Earning** | Income is **fixed** and may be increased if the employer decides to do so. There is **no risk** of reduced income so long as the employee continues to work. |
| **Freedom of Work** | The employee has to work according to the **terms and condition of employment**. |
| **Avenues** | Job opportunities exist in Government offices, Railways, Banks, Insurance companies, factories, trading concerns, Schools, Colleges, Hospitals, etc.. |
| **Typical Jobs** | Clerical jobs, technical jobs, laboratory assistants, office assistants, or computer operators. |

### B. Self-Employment
**Self-employment** refers to an occupation in which a person engages himself/herself in some economic activity **on his own** to earn his/her livelihood.

| Basis of Distinction | Self-Employment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Status or Position** | The position of the person is that of **owner** and may be that of an employer. |
| **Nature of Work** | Engages in activities **on one’s own**. Work is aimed at earning more and increasing business volume. The nature of work **cannot be decided in advance** and may vary. |
| **Income or Earning** | Income or earning is **not fixed**; it depends on the ability of the owner. |
| **Risk Bearing** | There is always a **risk of loss** sometimes, and earnings may decline at times. The owners bear this risk. |
| **Freedom of Work** | The owner is **free to decide** how to run the business depending on available opportunities. |
| **Examples** | Running a bookshop, medical store, tailoring shop, repair shops, grocery stores, hair-cutting saloons, etc.. |

### C. Preference for Self-Employment
Self-employment is often regarded as the **best solution for unemployment and growth** of the country. It is often preferred over wage employment for the following reasons:

1.  **Opportunity to Use Own Talent:** It offers opportunities for using one’s own talents for one’s benefit, allowing the person to use their ability and time in the most profitable manner.
2.  **Low Resource Requirement:** It is possible even without large resources of capital and facilities (e.g., a service shop can be started with limited capital).
3.  **Learning on the Job:** The person learns many things 'on the job' because they have to take all the decisions regarding their business activities for their own benefit.

### D. Possible Areas of Self-Employment
Self-employment opportunities exist in several areas:

*   **Small Scale Retail Business:** Easily started and managed profitably by single owners, often with one or two assistants (e.g., grocery store, stationery shop, cloth store).
*   **Services Based on Individual Skills:** Services rendered to customers based on specialized skills (e.g., repairing bicycles, tailoring, hairdressing).
*   **Occupations Based on Professional Qualifications:** Activities requiring professional training and experience (e.g., practicing Doctors, Lawyers, Chartered Accountants, Pharmacists, Architects). They offer services to clients, usually with small establishments like a clinic or office space.
*   **Small Scale Farming:** Activities like dairy, poultry, fishery, horticulture, and seri-culture.
*   **Village and Cottage Industries:** Based on traditional inherited skills (e.g., hand spinning, weaving, hand knitting, stitching garments).
*   **Arts and Crafts:** Occupations like goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and carpentry for those trained in craftsmanship or art.
