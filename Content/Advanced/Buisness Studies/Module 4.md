Thank you for continuing your detailed study of Business Studies! Based on the new sources you provided, this lesson will comprehensively cover **Buying, Selling, Distribution, Advertising, and Sales Promotion**, which are core elements of marketing in the modern business world.

***

## I. Purchase and Sale: The Core Business Activities

Purchase and sale are fundamental activities essential for the existence and growth of any business enterprise.

### A. Definition of Purchase and Sale
*   **Purchase:** A process where a person gets the **ownership of goods or properties transferred in his name** from another, in exchange for the payment of money. Business enterprises purchase items like raw materials, machinery, land, building, and stationery for production or office premises.
*   **Sale:** A process where the **ownership of goods or properties is transferred** from one person (seller) to another person (buyer) for a price.
*   **Relationship:** Sale and purchase **always go together**; whenever there is a sale, there is also a purchase, and vice versa.
*   **Parties Involved:** In every sale and purchase, there are two parties: the **seller** (who sells) and the **buyer** (who buys). The buyer pays money to the seller for buying goods or services for use or consumption.

### B. The Concept of Selling and Marketing
The goal of businessmen is to produce goods or services for others’ use and earn **profit** from their sale.

*   **Necessity of Sale:** Sale of goods is necessary for the **very existence** of business and its growth over time.
*   **Marketing Functions:** Selling is distinct from **marketing**, although selling is a part of the overall marketing function. Marketing functions encompass activities undertaken before production to ensure the product meets customer needs and is sold effectively:
    *   Identifying and determining customer requirements and designing the product accordingly.
    *   Ensuring customers derive satisfaction, necessitating continuous product improvement.
    *   Making the product or service easily available to customers.
    *   Setting the price affordably for customers.
    *   Making customers aware of the product, its benefits, both before and after sale.

### C. Basis of Purchase and Sale
Transactions can be conducted based on immediate payment or deferred payment.

1.  **Cash Basis (Immediate Payment):** The buyer pays the price immediately while taking delivery of the goods. Payment can be made in cash, by cheque, draft, credit card, or debit card, provided the seller agrees. This is normal practice for retail buying involving small payments (e.g., groceries, vegetables).
2.  **Credit Basis (Deferred Payment):**
    *   **Credit Purchase:** The buyer requests time (e.g., 15 or 30 days) to make payment after taking delivery, and the seller accepts. Sellers often cannot afford to stick to cash sales only in today's competitive environment, but must ensure the creditability and paying capacity of the buyer.
    *   **Deferred Payment at the end of the Credit Period:** Payment is made at the end of the agreed credit period (e.g., three months). A special discount may be allowed if the buyer pays earlier (prompt payment).
    *   **Deferred Instalment Plan ('Buy now – pay later'):** The buyer pays a nominal initial amount and takes possession, paying the balance in fixed instalments over time, plus interest (though sometimes interest-free instalments are offered). The seller can **sue the buyer** for the unpaid amount if default occurs.

### D. Modes of Purchase
Goods may be purchased in three main ways:

1.  **Purchase by Inspection:** The buyer personally goes to the seller and checks the goods before buying them. This is the **most common method**, especially in retail buying (e.g., buying a shirt or vegetables).
2.  **Purchase by Sample/Pattern:** Used when buying goods in **bulk**, as inspecting the whole lot is not feasible.
    *   **Sample:** A specimen of goods (like raw materials or foodstuffs) that reflects the quality of the bulk.
    *   **Pattern:** A specimen of standard manufactured goods (like cloth) that reveals shade and texture, sometimes bearing a code number. The bulk supply is agreed to be of the same quality as the sample/pattern shown.
3.  **Purchase by Description or Brand:** Used when showing a sample is impossible (e.g., furniture). The seller uses a catalogue and price list containing the **description** of goods. Alternatively, standardized goods are bought simply by mentioning the **brand name** (e.g., Godrej Storewell, Surf, Pepsodent).

### E. Methods of Sale
Various methods are used to sell products, particularly durable or expensive items:

1.  **Hire Purchase Basis:** Payment is made in instalments. **Goods are regarded as being on hire until all instalments are paid**, meaning ownership remains with the seller until the final payment. If the buyer defaults, the seller can ask for the goods to be returned and sue for damages. Used for durable items like cars, motorcycles, and machinery.
2.  **Instalment Payment System (Deferred Instalment Plan):** Goods are sold, and payment is made in instalments. In this case, **ownership rights pass to the buyer when the initial payment is made**. If the buyer defaults, the seller **cannot** ask for the goods to be returned but can only sue for the balance due.
3.  **Sale on Approval Basis:** A conditional sale where goods are delivered, often with initial payment, and the buyer can **return the goods** (or a part of them) and claim a refund within a specified period if they do not meet requirements. If the buyer does not communicate disapproval within the time limit, the sale is assumed.
4.  **Sale through Tender:** Used by big organizations or government agencies for large quantity requirements. Intending purchasers invite tenders (undertakings to supply materials/goods with stated terms and conditions). Tenders are received in sealed covers, and the most favourable one is accepted, leading to a formal contract. Tenderers usually deposit an **earnest money** to ensure seriousness.
5.  **Auction Sale:** Goods are sold openly on a specific date and time to the **highest bidder**. A **reserve price** (fixed by the seller) exists below which goods are not sold. A bid is considered an offer, and once accepted, the bidder must pay the price, though the seller has the liberty not to sell even at the highest bid. Auctions are now common through the internet.
6.  **Wash Sales:** Conducted to clear surplus or old stocks, often featuring **heavy discounts** (e.g., 'Grand Clearance Sale – Discounts up to 70%').

### F. The Selling Procedure (Selling Routine)
The transaction, especially in non-local trade, passes through various stages:

1.  **Enquiry from the Buyer:** The buyer collects information directly from the seller or manufacturer (or indirectly from advertisements/catalogues) regarding supply, price, and quality.
2.  **Quotation from the Seller:** Upon receiving the enquiry, the seller provides the required information, known as the **quotation**, detailing the price and terms/conditions of sale (which are open for negotiation).
3.  **Receipt of Order from the Buyer:** If satisfied with the quotation, the buyer issues a formal order to the seller.
4.  **Execution of the Order:** The seller acknowledges acceptance, stamps the order, and assigns a reference number. If it’s a new customer, the seller verifies creditworthiness. If satisfactory, the seller proceeds; otherwise, a letter of regret is sent. If goods are not in stock, a copy of the order goes to the production department to fix a delivery date.
5.  **Invoicing:** The seller prepares an **invoice** (bill), which contains transaction details and the amount due. It is sent with the goods to the buyer. Copies are retained by the seller and sent to the production/godown and accounts departments.
6.  **Opening Customer’s Account:** The accounts department opens a ledger account for the customer, recording the invoice price, credit allowed, and payments received.
7.  **Dispatch of Goods:** The goods are released (using the invoice/delivery note), checked by the packaging department, labelled, and sent to dispatch. A **Dispatch Note** (or Letter of Advice) is forwarded to the buyer, describing the goods and indicating how the buyer can take delivery.
8.  **Delivery of Goods to the Buyer:** The buyer takes delivery from the transport authority using the railway/transport receipt. The buyer must **check the goods thoroughly** for damage and immediately make a claim for compensation if damage is found.
9.  **Receipt of Payment and Settlement of Accounts:** Payment is made as agreed (e.g., money order, cheque, draft). Once full payment is received, the account is settled.
10. **Rectification of Errors:** Errors made in sending goods or preparing the invoice are rectified using notes:
    *   **Credit Note:** Informs the buyer that their account has been **credited** (reduced) with a particular amount (e.g., correcting an overcharge).
    *   **Debit Note:** Informs the buyer that their account has been **debited** (increased) with a particular amount (e.g., correcting an undercharge).

## II. Channels of Distribution

A **channel of distribution** is the route or path along which goods move from the producer to the ultimate consumer.

### A. Meaning of Channels of Distribution
Trade's main purpose is to supply goods to consumers. As goods move from the producer to the consumer, they may pass through various individuals called **middlemen** (such as agents, wholesalers, and retailers), who perform functions like buying, selling, and storage. These middlemen constitute the channel of distribution.

### B. Types of Channels
Channels are divided into Direct (no middlemen) and Indirect (involving middlemen).

#### 1. Direct Channel
The producer sells goods and services directly to the consumer, with **no middleman** involved.
*   **Producer $\rightarrow$ Consumer**.
*   **Methods:** Door-to-door salesmen or the producer’s own retail stores (e.g., Bata, Liberty Shoes).
*   **Services:** Used for certain service organizations (e.g., banks, consultancy firms, transport services).

#### 2. Indirect Channels
The producer sells through middlemen, necessary when production is on a large scale. The common indirect channels include:
*   **Producer $\rightarrow$ Retailer $\rightarrow$ Consumer:** Used when the goods cater to a local market (e.g., breads, biscuits) or when the retailers are big and buy in bulk (e.g., departmental stores and super bazars).
*   **Producer $\rightarrow$ Wholesaler $\rightarrow$ Retailer $\rightarrow$ Consumer:** The common channel for goods sold to ultimate consumers (e.g., food grains, spices, utensils, smaller items).
*   **Producer $\rightarrow$ Agent $\rightarrow$ Wholesaler $\rightarrow$ Retailer $\rightarrow$ Consumer**.
*   **Producer $\rightarrow$ Agent $\rightarrow$ Consumer**.
*   **Producer $\rightarrow$ Wholesaler $\rightarrow$ Consumer**.

## III. Retail Trade: Types and Operations

Retail trade involves selling goods and commodities in small quantities directly to consumers.

### A. Small-Scale Retail Trade
This trade sells a limited variety and quantity of goods within a local area, requiring less capital and serving a limited number of customers.

#### 1. Itinerant Retailing (Moving Retailers)
Retailers move around and sell a variety of items directly to consumers without a fixed shop.
*   **Examples:** Pedlars (selling peanuts, toys in buses), hawkers (selling fruits/vegetables using a cart), and street traders.
*   **Marketplaces:** May sell on fixed days at market places called "Haat" (villages) or "weekly bazars" (towns/cities).
*   **Pricing:** Price is often settled through **bargaining**; items sold are usually not branded.

#### 2. Fixed Shop Retailing
Retailers sell goods and services from a fixed shop, typically located in market places or near residential areas.
*   **General Store or Variety Store:** Deals with a wide variety of items for **daily general use** (e.g., toiletry, grocery, stationery). They typically sell for cash but may offer credit and home delivery to regular customers.
*   **Single Line Store:** Deals with a **specific line of goods** (e.g., medicine shops, bookshops, ready-made garment shops). They offer different sizes, brands, and qualities within that one product line.
*   **Speciality Store:** Deals with products of a **specific brand or company** (e.g., Woodland shoe shops, where all products are from the Woodland company).

### B. Large-Scale Retail Trade
This involves greater capital investment, deals with a large volume of goods, and caters to a large number of customers. These shops are usually situated at **central places** and make different types of goods available under one roof.

#### 1. Departmental Stores
A large-scale retail shop where a **large variety of goods are sold in a single building**. The building is divided into departments, each dealing with a specific type of goods (e.g., garments, electronic goods).

**Key Features:**
*   **Location:** Generally at the **main commercial centres** of cities/towns.
*   **Management:** Management and control of all departments is **centralized**.
*   **Facilities:** Provides additional services like restaurants, rest rooms, telephone, and ATMs to encourage customers to do all their shopping there.
*   **Pricing/Credit:** Sells goods on cash basis but may allow purchases against credit cards. Prices are generally **higher** than the market rate due to high operating costs.

**Limitations:** Heavy capital investment; far from residential areas; high cost of business operations; and **lack of personal attention** (since employees interact with customers, not the owner).

#### 2. Super Bazar (Consumers’ Co-operative Store)
A large-scale retail organization selling a wide variety of products (food items, groceries, durable goods) all under one roof, formed as a **co-operative society**.
*   **Objective:** Selling goods of daily necessity to members and the general public at a **reasonable price** by eliminating middlemen.
*   **Operation:** Often runs on a **self-service basis**, where customers pick goods from open shelves and pay at the counter.
*   **Pricing/Credit:** Goods are sold **only on cash basis**. Prices are generally **cheaper** than departmental stores due to avoidance of middlemen.
*   **Management:** Managed by elected members of the society. Lack of efficient management is a limitation because they often cannot afford professional managers.
*   **Control:** In India, most Super Bazars are controlled by Central and State Governments, which helps maintain price stability.

#### 3. Multiple Shops (Chain Stores)
Shops with the same name, same design, dealing in a similar range of commodities at the **same uniform price** in all their shops. They are usually owned and run by **big manufacturers/producers** who open many branches near customers.

**Key Features:**
*   **Management:** Centrally managed and controlled by the **head office**.
*   **Goods:** Deal in similar types of goods, mostly of everyday use (e.g., shoes, watches, textiles).
*   **Pricing/Credit:** Price is **uniform** in all shops, avoiding bargaining and cheating. Sales are **strictly on cash basis**, eliminating the risk of bad debts and credit facility.
*   **Advantages:** Easy identification due to uniform decoration; elimination of middlemen; low operating cost/low price; and high public confidence due to standard quality.
*   **Limitations:** Limited choice of products (restricted to one brand); lack of initiative by branch managers (as they follow strict instructions).

#### 4. Malls and Outlets
*   **Malls:** Latest mode of retail trade, providing not only shopping for world-renowned brands (clothing, electronics, etc.) but also **entertainment facilities**. Malls provide an exquisite shopping experience and are used for various meetings and events.
*   **Outlets/Factory Outlets:** Stores in which **manufacturers sell their stock directly to the public**. This eliminates mediators, allowing customers to buy goods at a low price while providing assured quality.

### C. Non-Store Retailing
Technological advancement allows purchasing goods without physically visiting a fixed shop.

1.  **Mail Order Business (Shopping by Post):** The seller advertises through media (newspapers, magazines, catalogues), and the customer sends the order by post. The seller sends the goods via **Value Payable Post (VPP)**, and the post office collects the money from the buyer and remits it to the seller.
    *   **Suitable Goods:** Light weight, durable, non-perishable goods with high demand and low delivery charges relative to price. **Not suitable for illiterates**.
2.  **Tele-Shopping:** Sellers advertise products (often with live demonstration) on television or other media, displaying the price and phone number. The customer dials the number, places the order, and the goods are delivered upon receipt of payment.
    *   **Limitations:** Since orders are oral, disputes are difficult to resolve. No facility for inspection of goods (risk of fraud). Credit facility is not available.
3.  **Automatic Vending Machine:** Provides **round-the-clock facility**. Customers insert a coin or token to buy specified goods (e.g., milk, newspapers).
    *   **Advantages:** Operation is simple (even for illiterates); no risk of fraud or manipulation; no advertisement required; all sales are for cash.
    *   **Limitations:** High initial investment; requires frequent repairs and stock loading.
4.  **Internet Shopping (On-line Shopping):** The seller provides information through a website. Customers view products, compare prices, place orders, and make payments via **credit card** [, 149].
    *   **Advantages:** Operation is simple (even for illiterates); no risk of fraud or manipulation; no advertisement required; all sales are for cash.
    *   **Limitations:** High initial investment; requires frequent repairs and stock loading.
4.  **Internet Shopping (On-line Shopping):** The seller provides information through a website. Customers view products, compare prices, place orders, and make payments via **credit card**. The supplier delivers goods via post or courier.
    *   **Advantages:** Goods from the international market can be purchased from home; saves time and effort; quickest mode of retailing.
    *   **Limitations:** Requires knowledge of computers; does not allow physical inspection; reliance on credit card payment; and absence of the pleasure of personal shopping.
