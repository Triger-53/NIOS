## I. Consumer Awareness: Defining the Consumer and Consumerism

The main objective of every business should be **consumer satisfaction**. However, consumers are often exploited by businessmen through practices like selling low-quality or adulterated goods, or charging higher prices. This exploitation often occurs because consumers lack awareness regarding their rights and responsibilities.

### A. Who is a Consumer?
Simply put, a consumer is a person who **consumes or uses various goods and services**.

**Definition:** A consumer is a person who buys goods or services to be **used or consumed by himself/herself or by someone else on behalf of the buyer**. They choose goods and services, spend money to obtain them, and use them to satisfy their needs.

*   **Goods:** May include consumable goods (like wheat flour, salt, sugar, fruits) or durable consumer goods (like a refrigerator, television, or bicycle).
*   **Services:** Services paid for may include transport, electricity, telephone, film shows, and the like.

**Distinction (Buyer vs. Consumer):**
*   A person who buys goods for **resale** (like a retail trader buying stationery from a wholesaler) is **not a consumer** but a trader.
*   A buyer who purchases an item for his **own use** (e.g., a shopkeeper buying a readymade shirt for himself) **is a consumer**.

### B. Consumer of Goods vs. Consumer of Services
Both types of consumers purchase items for their benefit, but there is a key difference.

| Feature | Consumer of Goods (e.g., TV, fruits) | Consumer of Services (e.g., taxi ride, electricity) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical Verification** | Quality of goods can often be **physically verified before buying** (e.g., checking TV picture quality or tasting a sample of food). | Reliability and regularity of services **cannot be verified beforehand** (e.g., stable electricity voltage or a taxi driver's cautiousness). |
| **Storability** | Goods can be consumed instantly or **stored for a period of time** (e.g., storing cereals for a month or using a refrigerator for years). | Services generally **cannot be stored** (e.g., transport services, electric supply, or a film show).

### C. Meaning of Consumerism
Consumerism refers to the **self-effort** on the part of consumers for safeguarding themselves.

**Definition:** Consumerism refers to a **movement by consumers** to ensure fair and honest (ethical) practices on the part of manufacturers, traders, dealers, and service providers in relation to consumers.

*   This movement is an attempt by individual consumer activists and consumer associations to create **consumer awareness** about malpractices in the market and find ways to protect their interests.
*   This movement will only be successful if consumers are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities.

## II. Rights of Consumers

To prevent consumers from being exploited or cheated, the Government has recognized and provided certain rights. These rights, especially enshrined in the **Consumer Protection Act, 1986**, empower consumers to ensure sellers are careful in dealing with them.

There are six core rights provided under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986:

1.  **Right to Safety:** Consumers have the right to be **protected against the marketing of goods which are injurious to health and life**.
    *   If injury is caused, the consumer has the right to complain and claim compensation.
    *   *Example:* If a substandard medicine proves harmful, the seller can be held responsible. If a gas cylinder leaks and causes fire/injury, the supplier is liable to pay compensation.
2.  **Right to Be Informed:** Consumers have the right to be informed about the **quantity, quality, purity, standard or grade, and price** of the goods available so they can make a proper choice.
    *   The consumer must also be informed about necessary **safety precautions** while using the product (e.g., turning off the gas regulator when not in use).
3.  **Right to Choose:** Every consumer has the right to **choose the goods needed from a wide variety of similar goods**.
    *   This right prevents shopkeepers from using pressure tactics to sell goods of inferior quality or specific brands on which they receive a higher commission.
4.  **Right to Be Heard:** This right has three interpretations:
    *   Consumers have the right to be **consulted by Government and public bodies** when policies affecting consumer interests are made.
    *   Consumers have the right to be heard by **manufacturers, dealers, and advertisers** about their opinion on production and marketing decisions.
    *   Consumers have the right to be heard in **legal proceedings** in courts dealing with consumer complaints (at the appropriate forum).
5.  **Right to Seek Redressal:** If a consumer has a grievance due to unfair trade practices (high price, inferior goods, unsafe products, deficiency in service) or has suffered loss/injury, they have the right to **seek remedies**.
    *   This includes the right to get **defective goods replaced**, money refunded, and to seek legal remedies.
    *   This right provides for **compensation** if the consumer has suffered a loss or inconvenience due to the fault of the supplier or manufacturer.
6.  **Right to Consumer Education:** To prevent market malpractices and exploitation, consumers need awareness and education.
    *   This right expects associations, educational institutions, and policy makers to inform consumers about: (a) relevant laws preventing unfair practices; (b) how dishonest traders manipulate the market; (c) how consumers can protect their own interest; and (d) the procedure for making complaints.

## III. Responsibilities of Consumers

Rights cannot exist without responsibilities. To be entitled to exercise their rights, consumers must be responsible enough to fulfill certain duties.

1.  **Responsibility of Self-Help:** A consumer should **not depend on the seller for information and choice** as far as possible. An informed consumer can best take care of his/her own interest. It is better to be forewarned than to seek remedies after suffering loss.
2.  **Proof of Transactions:** Consumers must **invariably obtain and preserve the proof of purchase** and related documents.
    *   It is crucial to get a **cash memo** upon purchase of goods.
    *   For durable goods (like TV or refrigerator), **warranty/guarantee cards** should be preserved, as they entitle the consumer to free service, repairs, or replacement during the specified period. Proof of purchase is essential to establish a claim for repair or replacement.
3.  **Proper Claim:** When making complaints and claiming compensation, consumers should **not make unreasonably higher claims**. Making excessively high claims for no apparent reason is considered an irresponsible act.
4.  **Proper Use of Product/Services:** Consumers must **always use the products properly**. They should not make rough use of a product during the guarantee period, mistakenly thinking it will be replaced easily.
    *   Additionally, consumers should stick to agreements, make timely payments for credit purchases, and **not tamper with the media of services** (e.g., electric meters, bus/train seats).

## IV. Consumer Protection: Problems and Need

**Consumer Protection** refers to the steps and measures required to be accepted to protect consumers from business malpractices. It may be regarded as a movement, similar to consumerism, primarily necessary because businessmen aim to maximize profits, often at the expense of consumers.

### A. Problems Faced by Consumers (Unfair Practices)
Consumers may be deceived in various ways by unscrupulous producers, traders, and service providers:

1.  **Adulteration:** Adding something inferior to the product being sold (e.g., mixing mustard oil with argemone oil, or black pepper with dry papaya seeds). The inferior material may sometimes be injurious to health.
2.  **Sale of Spurious Products:** Selling something of no value instead of the real product (e.g., ampules for injections containing only water, or bottles labeled as glucose water containing only distilled water).
3.  **Use of False Weights and Measures:** Using false weights (1 Kg, 500 grams, etc.) or measuring tapes/sticks with false markings. Packaged and sealed goods may also contain less quantity than stated on the label, which is difficult to verify.
4.  **Sale of Duplicates:** Selling goods that carry a well-known brand mark but are locally made or inferior, thereby charging a higher price.
5.  **Hoarding and Black-marketing:**
    *   **Hoarding:** Intentionally holding back essential commodity stocks to create an **artificial scarcity** and push up prices.
    *   **Black Marketing:** Selling hoarded goods secretly at a **higher price**.
6.  **Tie-in-Sales:** Requiring buyers of a product (e.g., a new gas connection) to purchase some other goods (e.g., a gas stove) as a pre-condition for the sale, or demanding advance payment for future service charges.
7.  **Offering Gifts/Coupons with No Value:** Practices aimed at alluring consumers to buy a product, often after the price of the product has been increased, or announcing contests without the intention of awarding a prize.
8.  **Misleading Advertisement:** Advertisements that **falsely represent a product** or service to be of superior quality, grade, or standard, or falsely assert its usefulness. *Example: Falsely claiming a technical collaboration with a foreign company or using a trademark without proper permission*.
9.  **Sale of Sub-Standard Goods:** Selling goods that **do not conform to prescribed quality standards**, particularly for safety (e.g., pressure cookers, electric heaters, cooking gas cylinders).

### B. Need for Consumer Protection
The necessity of protecting consumers arises mainly due to their **helpless position** and the prevalence of **unfair business practices**.

*   **Lack of Awareness and Ignorance:** Consumers are unable to make use of their basic rights due to lack of awareness and ignorance. They often fail to make the right choice due to misleading advertisements.
*   **Inability to Verify Quality:** Consumers are sometimes helpless in verifying the quality of products (e.g., if the date of expiry on a medicine strip is illegible, they rely on the seller).
*   **Misguided Beliefs:** Consumers are often guided by baseless beliefs, such as the idea that **‘higher price indicates better quality’** or that all imported goods are superior.
*   **Difficulty in Verification:** It is difficult to verify weights before buying packaged goods, and weighing machines used by sellers may sometimes be defective.
*   **Lack of Knowledge of Remedies:** Consumers are not fully aware of the remedies available to them if goods are defective or services are deficient.

## V. Parties and Legal Framework for Consumer Protection

For effective consumer protection, all three parties must be involved: **Consumers, Businessmen, and Government**.

### A. Role of Key Parties
1.  **Consumers (Self-Help):** Consumers must take care of their own interest by knowing and asserting their rights. They should attend training programmes organized by consumer associations to learn about their rights and available legal remedies.
2.  **Businessmen:** Producers, distributors, dealers, and retailers should respect consumer rights and ensure the supply of **quality goods and services at reasonable prices**. Associations of traders (Chambers of Commerce and Industry) should handle consumer complaints against their members and take action against malpractice.
3.  **Government:** The Government has the responsibility for consumer protection in the general interest of society. This involves enforcing and amending laws, and associating representatives of consumer groups with policy-making bodies.

### B. Legal Protection to Consumers
The Government of India has passed several laws specifically to protect consumer interests:

| Act | Year | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agricultural Products (Grading and Marketing) Act** | 1937 | Provides for grading and certifying the quality of agricultural commodities with the **AGMARK** seal. |
| **Industries (Development and Regulation) Act** | 1951 | Provides control over production and distribution. Government can order investigation and take over undertakings if there is a marked decline in quality or unreasonable price rise. |
| **Prevention of Food Adulteration Act** | 1954 | Provides **severe punishment** (up to life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3,000 minimum) for the adulteration of food articles, especially if injurious to health. |
| **Essential Commodities Act** | 1955 | Government can declare any commodity as essential and control its production, supply, and distribution. Provides action against profiteers, **hoarders, and black-marketers**. |
| **The Standards of Weights and Measures Act** | 1956 | Provides for the use of **standard weights and measures** throughout the country (Metre for length, Kilogram for weight), eliminating localized variations that previously allowed exploitation. |
| **Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act (MRTP)** | 1969 | Consumers or consumer groups can file complaints about restrictive and unfair trade practices. The MRTP commission can award **compensation** for loss or injury. |
| **Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Essential Supplies Act** | 1980 | Provides for the **detention of persons** involved in black-marketing and other anti-social activities for up to 6 months. |
| **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act** | 1986 | Established the BIS (replacing ISI) to formulate quality standards and certify products through the **ISI certification mark**. Consumers can complain to its public grievances cell about products carrying the ISI mark. |
| **Consumer Protection Act (COPRA)** | **1986** | Provides the most comprehensive consumer protection, covering goods and deficiency in services (banking, transport, electricity, housing, etc.). It established a **semi-judicial system** (consumer courts) for dispute settlement. |

***

## VI. Redressal Mechanism: Consumer Courts

The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, established a three-tier **semi-judicial system** for the settlement of consumer disputes, known as consumer courts:

| Consumer Court | Jurisdiction (Pecuniary Value of Goods/Compensation Claimed) | Appeals |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **District Forum** | Does not exceed **Rs 20 lakhs**. | Appeals are handled by the State Commission. |
| **State Commission** | Exceeds Rs 20 lakhs but **does not exceed Rs One Crore**. | Deals with appeals against District Forum orders. Appeals are handled by the National Commission. |
| **National Commission** | Exceeds **Rs One Crore**. | Deals with appeals against State Commission orders. Appeals are handled by the Supreme Court. |

### A. Procedure for Filing a Complaint
Any individual consumer or association of consumers can lodge a written complaint:

1.  **Where to File:** Complaint is filed before the relevant District Forum, State Commission, or National Commission where the cause of action arose or the opposite party resides.
2.  **Required Information:** The complaint must include the name, description, and address of the complainant and the opposite party; facts of the complaint (when/where it arose); supporting documents (cash memo, receipt); and the nature of relief sought.
3.  **Time Limit:** The complaint must be filed within **two years** from the date on which the cause of action arose.
4.  **Process:** A nominal fee is charged. The complaint (five copies generally required) must be signed by the complainant or authorized agent and can be filed in person or sent by post.
5.  **Decision Time:** Complaints are generally expected to be decided within **three months** from the date of notice. If testing/laboratory analysis is required, the period is extended to **five months**.

### B. Possible Reliefs
Depending on the case, the Redressal Forum/Commission may order one or more of the following reliefs:
*   Removal of defect in goods or deficiency in services.
*   Replacement of the defective goods or restoration of the service.
*   Refund of the price paid for goods or adjustment/refund of excess charge paid for service.
*   Compensation for loss or injury suffered.

## VII. Role of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)

NGOs are non-profit, voluntary associations aiming to promote public welfare, free from government interference. Those dealing with consumer issues are known as consumer associations or consumer organizations.

The role of NGOs has become increasingly significant, with over 800 such organizations in India. They perform several crucial functions:

1.  **Consumer Education:** Create awareness about consumer rights and educate the public about problems and remedies through seminars, workshops, and training programmes.
2.  **Legal Aid:** Provide assistance to consumers in seeking legal remedies.
3.  **Advocacy:** Represent consumers as members of consumer protection councils and other official bodies, exercising the **Right to be Heard**.
4.  **Comparative Testing:** Arrange testing of competing brands through their own apparatus or accredited laboratories and **publish the results** to help consumers become informed buyers.
5.  **Publishing:** Publish periodicals and journals to disseminate information about consumer problems and legal reporting. Most of these publications do not accept advertisements from business firms.
6.  **Policy Recommendations:** Make suggestions to government authorities regarding policy making and administrative measures in the interest of consumers.
7.  **Public Interest Litigation (PIL):** Successfully file cases in law courts in the interest of the general public, enforcing consumer rights for large groups rather than just individuals.
