## Part 1: Demand

Demand represents the behavior of buyers in the market. To satisfy wants, consumers purchase goods and services by paying a price.

### 1. Meaning and Components of Demand

**Demand for a good is defined as the quantity of the good purchased at a given price at a given time**.

The definition of demand includes three essential components:
1.  **Quantity of the commodity bought**.
2.  **Price of the commodity**.
3.  **Time period** (which may vary, such as a week, month, or year).

**Demand vs. Desire:** It is important not to confuse demand with mere desire. **Demand is a desire backed by the ability to purchase**, meaning the person must have the money to purchase the good by paying its price. Anyone can desire a good, but only when the price is paid does it become a demand.

### 2. Individual Demand and Market Demand

*   **Individual Demand:** Refers to the quantity of a commodity that a single buyer is willing to buy at a given price per unit of time.
*   **Market Demand:** This is the **total quantity of a commodity demanded by all the individual buyers in the market** at the given price at a given time. Market demand is calculated by summing the individual demand schedules of all buyers.

### 3. Factors Affecting Individual Demand (Determinants)

How much quantity a single buyer is willing to buy depends on the following factors:

| Factor | Relationship | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price of the commodity** | **Inverse** | Generally, buyers are willing to buy more quantity at a lower price and less at a higher price, assuming all other factors remain constant. |
| **Price of related goods** | Varies | (a) **Substitute Goods** (e.g., coke and pepsi): Demand for a commodity is **directly related** to the price of its substitute. If the price of coffee increases, the demand for tea increases. (b) **Complementary Goods** (e.g., car and petrol): Demand for a commodity is **inversely related** to the price of its complementary good. If the price of petrol rises, the demand for cars decreases. |
| **Income of the buyer** | Varies | (a) **Normal Goods** (e.g., fruits): Demand is **directly related** to income (demand increases as income increases). (b) **Inferior Goods** (e.g., jowar, bajra): Demand is **inversely related** to income (demand decreases as income increases). |
| **Tastes, preferences, and fashion** | Direct | Demand increases for goods that are preferred or are in fashion. |

### 4. The Law of Demand and the Demand Curve

The Law of Demand establishes the relationship between price and quantity demanded when all factors other than the commodity's price remain unchanged (constant).

*   **Law of Demand:** **"If price of a commodity falls, its quantity demanded increases and if price of the commodity rises, its quantity demanded falls, other things remaining constant."**. This means price and quantity demanded are **inversely related**.
*   **Demand Schedule:** A tabular presentation of different quantities of a commodity demanded at different prices.
*   **Demand Curve:** The diagrammatic representation of the Law of Demand.
    *   **Shape:** Due to the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, the demand curve **slopes downwards from left to right**.

**Reasons for the Downward Slope of the Demand Curve:**
1.  **Diminishing Marginal Satisfaction:** As more units of a commodity are consumed, the satisfaction derived from successive units goes on diminishing, making buyers willing to pay less for additional units.
2.  **Income Effect:** When the price of a commodity falls, the buyer's real income (purchasing power) increases, allowing them to buy a greater quantity with the same money income.
3.  **Substitution Effect:** When a commodity's price falls, it becomes relatively cheaper than its substitutes, inducing people to buy more of that commodity (substituting it for others).

### 5. Factors Affecting Market Demand

Market demand is influenced by all the factors affecting individual demand, plus additional factors:

1.  **Number of buyers:** If the number of buyers increases, market demand will increase.
2.  **Distribution of income and wealth:** If income distribution favours the rich, demand for goods preferred by the rich will be higher; if it favours the poor, demand for goods preferred by the poor will be higher.
3.  **Climatic condition:** Demand for commodities like ice increases in summer, and demand for woollens increases in winter.

## Part 2: Supply

Supply represents the behavior of producers and sellers in the market. Commodities must be produced, stored, and transported to the market to be available for buyers. Producers include farmers, manufacturers (who produce consumer goods), and sellers.

### 1. Meaning of Supply and Stock

*   **Supply:** **Supply of a commodity is the quantity of the commodity that a seller offers for sale at a given price at a given time**.
    *   Like demand, the definition includes quantity offered for sale, the price at which the seller is willing to sell, and the time period.
*   **Stock:** The **total quantity of a commodity available with a seller/firm at a particular point of time** is called stock.
    *   **Relationship:** Supply is that **part of the stock** that the seller is ready to sell at a given price during a given time period. Stock is measured at a particular **point of time** (e.g., August 1st), while supply is measured over a **period of time** (e.g., the month of August).

### 2. Individual Supply and Market Supply

*   **Individual Supply:** Supply of a commodity by an individual firm is called individual supply. An **Individual Supply Schedule** is a tabular presentation of different quantities supplied by a firm at different prices.
*   **Market Supply:** The **total quantity of a commodity supplied by all the firms in the market** at a given price at a given time is called the market supply. The **Market Supply Schedule** is the sum of the quantities supplied by all firms in the market at different prices.

### 3. Factors Affecting Individual Supply

The quantity supplied by a firm is influenced by several determinants:

1.  **Price of the commodity:** Higher the price, higher will be the average revenue and profit margin, inducing the firm to supply more.
2.  **Technology of production:** An improvement in technology **reduces the cost of production** per unit, increasing the profit margin and inducing the firm to supply more.
3.  **Price of inputs:** If the price of inputs (like raw materials) falls, the cost of production per unit falls, increasing the margin of profit and causing the supply to increase (and vice versa).
4.  **Price of other related goods:** If the price of a related good (like rice for a farmer producing wheat and rice) increases, the farmer will divert resources to produce more of the profitable good (rice), decreasing the supply of the other good (wheat).
5.  **Objective of the firm:** A firm aiming to maximize sales may supply more, even at a lower price, compared to a firm focused purely on maximizing profit.
6.  **Government policy (Taxes/Subsidies):** Increasing taxes (like VAT or sales tax) increases the cost of production per unit, decreasing supply. A reduction in tax decreases cost and increases supply.

### 4. The Law of Supply and the Supply Curve

The Law of Supply describes the relationship between the price of a commodity and the quantity supplied, assuming all other factors remain constant.

*   **Law of Supply:** **"All other factors determining supply remaining constant, the price of a commodity and its quantity supplied are directly related."**. This means firms supply more quantity at a higher price and less at a lower price.
*   **Supply Curve:** The diagrammatic representation of the law of supply.
    *   **Shape:** Due to the **direct relationship** between price and quantity supplied, the supply curve is **upward sloping** (starts closer to the origin and moves up towards the right).

**Reasons for the Upward Slope of the Supply Curve:**
1.  **Profit Motive:** A rise in price causes a rise in profits, which induces firms to supply more quantity to increase their overall profit.
2.  **Inducement to Sell Stock:** A rise in price induces the seller to dispose of at least a part of their existing stock.
3.  **Entry of New Firms:** An increase in price leading to higher profit attracts new firms to enter the market, adding to the total market supply.

### 5. Factors Affecting Market Supply

In addition to the factors affecting individual supply, market supply is determined by:

1.  **Number of sellers/firms:** If the number of firms increases, market supply will increase. If the number of firms decreases, market supply will decrease.
2.  **Expected future price:** If the price is expected to **rise** in the near future, the firm will supply **less** now (to sell later at a higher price). If the price is expected to **fall**, the firm will supply **more** now.

## Part 3: Determination of Price and Quantity

The interaction between demand (buyers' behavior) and supply (sellers' behavior) determines the price of a commodity in the market.

### 1. Meaning of Price

The **price** of a good or service is the amount of money a buyer pays for one unit of that good or service. The market price is the price at which a commodity is sold in the market.

**Factors Influencing a Sellerâ€™s Price Fixing Decision:**
1.  **Cost of production:** The seller fixes a price that is more than the per unit cost of production to ensure a profit margin.
2.  **Price fixed by other sellers:** If a seller fixes a price much higher than competitors, they may lose sales and may have to decrease the price.
3.  **Expected sales at different prices:** The price must maximize total profit by finding the optimal balance between price and expected sales quantity.

### 2. Equilibrium Price

**Equilibrium** means a state of balance where there is no tendency to change.

*   **Equilibrium Price:** The price at which the **quantity demanded of a commodity is equal to its quantity supplied**.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity:** The quantity demanded and quantity supplied at the equilibrium price.
*   **Determination:** The equilibrium price is determined by the **forces of demand and supply** in the market.

### 3. Disequilibrium Situations and Adjustment

Situations where quantity demanded and supplied are unequal are called disequilibrium situations.

| Situation | Description | Effect on Price | Adjustment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Excess Demand** | Quantity demanded is **more** than quantity supplied (occurs at a price lower than equilibrium price). | Price starts **rising**. | The price will continue to rise until it reaches the equilibrium price, where demand equals supply. |
| **Excess Supply** | Quantity supplied is **more** than quantity demanded (occurs at a price higher than equilibrium price). | Price starts **falling**. | The price will continue to fall until it reaches the equilibrium price, where supply equals demand. |

### 4. Effects of Changes in Demand and Supply

Changes in demand or supply cause the equilibrium price and quantity to change:

*   **Change in Demand (Supply Constant):**
    *   If demand **increases**, both equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity demanded and supplied will **increase**.
    *   If demand **decreases**, both equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity demanded and supplied will **decrease**.
*   **Change in Supply (Demand Constant):**
    *   If supply **increases**, equilibrium price will **decrease**, but equilibrium quantity demanded and supplied will **increase**.
    *   If supply **decreases**, equilibrium price will **increase**, but equilibrium quantity demanded and supplied will **decrease**.

## Part 4: Market Structures

A market refers to the arrangement where buyers and sellers interact, directly or indirectly (via agents, telephone, or internet), to exchange goods or services for money and determine the price and quantity traded.

The structure of the market is based on factors like the nature of the product and the number of sellers and buyers.

### 1. Monopoly Market

The word 'Monopoly' means 'single seller'.

*   **Definition:** A market structure with a **single firm** producing all the output, and there is **no close substitute** of the product sold, thereby ruling out competition.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **A single firm:** The monopolist is the only producer.
    *   **No close substitutes:** The commodity is unique.
    *   **Price Maker:** The monopolist determines the price of the commodity as there is no competition. However, if they fix a high price, less quantity will be demanded.
    *   **No Entry of New Firm:** Entry barriers prevent new firms from competing.
    *   In monopoly, there is **no difference between the firm and the industry**.
    *   The aim is generally to maximize profit.
*   **Examples in India:** Government monopolies exist in atomic energy, defence, public water supply systems, and railways.

### 2. Perfectly Competitive Market

This is the opposite extreme situation to monopoly.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Large number of sellers and buyers:** Many sellers sell the commodity to a large number of buyers.
    *   **Homogeneous product:** All sellers sell the same type of product, making the product a **perfect substitute**.
    *   **Free entry and exit:** There are no barriers for new firms to enter or existing firms to leave the market.
    *   Sellers and buyers have **perfect knowledge** about the product and market situation.
    *   The government does not interfere in business.

### 3. Market Structure in the Real World

Pure monopoly (except government monopolies) and perfect competition rarely exist in the real world. Modern markets, characterized by many sellers offering slightly different varieties of the same product (e.g., different brands of soap differing in colour, fragrance, and packaging), are often called **monopolistic or imperfect competition**.

### 4. Classification by Channels of Distribution

Markets are also classified based on the volume of sale or distribution channel:

*   **Wholesale markets:** Goods are transacted in **big lots**. A wholesaler sells mainly to retailers and institutions, acting as the essential link between manufacturers and end consumers.
*   **Retail markets:** Goods are sold in **small lots** for direct consumption by the purchaser. Retailers sell normally to the ultimate consumers. The retailer's position is critical because they are in direct contact with the final consumers, making the location and proper presentation of commodities very important.

### 5. Online Market (Electronic Commerce)

Online shopping allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the internet without an intermediary service. It is also known as electronic commerce. Online stores are generally available 24 hours a day.

## Part 5: Role of Government in Price Determination

While demand and supply forces usually determine equilibrium price, the government often intervenes to protect the interests of consumers or producers.

### 1. Administered Price

When the government fixes a price either below or above the equilibrium price, it is called an **administered price** (Government determined price). These include:

#### (i) Control Price (Ceiling Price)
*   **Definition:** The maximum price fixed by the government, which is generally **lower than the equilibrium price**, to protect the interests of consumers (especially the poor).
*   **Purpose:** Used when production is less than demand, leading to high market prices.
*   **Consequences:** Fixing a price below equilibrium may cause **excess demand** (shortage) and the problem of **black marketing** (sellers illegally charging higher prices).
*   **Solutions:** Government may resort to **rationing** (fixing quota per head) or **dual price policy** to solve black marketing.

#### (ii) Support Price (Minimum Support Price)
*   **Definition:** The minimum price fixed by the government, which is generally **higher than the equilibrium price**, to protect the interests of producers (especially farmers).
*   **Purpose:** Used when bumper crops cause market prices to fall so low that farmers cannot even cover their cost of production.
*   **Consequences:** May create a situation of **excess supply**.
*   **Government Action:** In case of excess supply, the government is ready to purchase any quantity of the commodity to make a **buffer stock**.

#### (iii) Token Price
*   **Definition:** A price fixed by the government or charitable institutions that is **much below the per unit cost of production**.
*   **Purpose:** To ensure essential goods/services (like medical care, education) are available to poor people who cannot afford prevailing market prices. It is charged mainly to **prevent the wasteful use** of these services.

#### (iv) Dual Price Policy
*   Under this policy, a part of the total output is sold at the **control price** through **fair price shops**, while the remaining part is sold at the **prevailing market price** (determined by demand and supply) in the open market. This policy helps check black marketing.

### 2. Effect of Taxes and Subsidies

Government policies influence market price:

*   **Taxes (Excise Duty, Sales Tax):** Taxes increase the cost paid by producers/sellers. They recover these from buyers, so an increase in the rate of tax will **increase the market price** of commodities.
*   **Subsidies:** Government grants subsidies to producers to help them sell goods at a lower price. An increase in subsidy leads to a **decrease in the market price** of the commodity.

### 3. Public Distribution System (PDS)

The PDS is a system adopted in India to help poor people afford essential commodities by making them available at cheaper rates through fair price shops (ration shops).

**Essential Elements of PDS:**
1.  **Subsidy:** The government provides subsidies, keeping the prices of PDS commodities relatively lower.
2.  **Fixed quantity (Rationing):** The government fixes a quantity quota per head per unit of time based on minimum requirements, managed through a **ration card**.
3.  **Fair Price Shops (FPS):** These shops distribute the commodities, receiving a quota based on the number of ration cards registered with them.
