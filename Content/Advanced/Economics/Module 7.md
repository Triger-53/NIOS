## Part 1: An Overview of the Indian Economy

As citizens, understanding the economy of India is vital. India gained independence on August 15, 1947, following nearly two centuries of British rule.

### 1. State of the Indian Economy at Independence

The British rule aimed primarily to exploit India's resources for the gain of England, rather than developing the country or its citizens.

#### (i) Decline of Handicraft Industry
Before the British arrived, Indian kings promoted local artisans, carpenters, weavers, and artists who created beautiful goods using local skills and labour, often requiring long periods of concentration. This traditional industry suffered because:
1.  The British defeated the kings, leading to the destruction of towns and the closure of handicraft industries.
2.  England industrialized, replacing human labour with machines, allowing goods (especially textiles) to be produced at a large scale and sold in India at a **cheaper price**.
3.  British government policies were designed specifically to help British producers.

#### (ii) Production of Cash Crops
As industrialization progressed in England, factories needed raw materials. The British encouraged poor Indian farmers to cultivate **cash crops** (crops used in factories as raw materials) like raw cotton, indigo, jute, sugarcane, and ground nuts, by offering them money. This shift led to the British profiting by selling the factory-made goods back into the Indian market.

#### (iii) Famines and Food Shortage
The British period was marked by frequent occurrences of **famines**, situations where many people died from hunger and disease due to lack of food. Nearly 33 famines occurred during British rule, including the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, where over 1.5 million people died. Reasons for famines included:
1.  Bad rainfall and lack of irrigation facilities, meaning agriculture depended heavily on rain.
2.  The British government continued **exporting food grains** to England and other countries (often to feed its soldiers fighting wars globally) solely to earn revenue, even when there was local need.
3.  Poor people lacked the money needed to purchase food grains from the market.
4.  The encouragement of cash crop production reduced the area available for growing food grains.

#### (iv) Intermediaries in Agriculture
Agriculture was the major occupation for over 70% of the population and the main source of government revenue during British rule. The British introduced land revenue systems:
*   **Permanent settlement:** Land revenue collected was permanently fixed.
*   **Temporary settlement:** Land revenue was changed every 25–30 years.

To collect this revenue, the British appointed **intermediaries** (Zamindars in the East, Mahalwari in the West, Ryotwari in the South). These intermediaries collected rent and taxes mercilessly, even during poor harvests, and kept a portion for themselves before submitting the rest to the British government. They became powerful mini-rulers who exploited the common person, using force to seize belongings from those who failed to pay.

### 2. Positive Contributions of British Rule

Despite the exploitation, some positive developments occurred during the British period:
*   The **Railways** were introduced in 1850.
*   The first jute mill, cotton mill, and coal mine were established between 1850 and 1855.
*   Telecommunication, telegraph, and post offices were established.

### 3. Features of the Indian Economy After Independence

After 1947, the government of India prioritized taking the country toward higher development and achieving welfare for all citizens. Major features include:

#### (i) Low Level of Per Capita Income (PCI)
Per capita income (PCI) is calculated by dividing national income by population, indicating the average income earned by an individual in a year.
*   India's PCI for 2009–10 was **₹33,731** (or about ₹2,811 per month).
*   This amount is considered very low and insufficient to lead a decent life, given the price of essential items like food grains, clothes, and vegetables.

#### (ii) Slow Growth of Per Capita Income
India's PCI is not only low but grows very slowly. People need increasing income because their wants are increasing, and the prices of goods they buy are rising (inflation).
*   The increase in PCI between 2008–09 (₹31,801) and 2009–10 (₹33,731) was only ₹1,930 annually, or about ₹160 per month. This slow increase is often insufficient to satisfy existing wants, let alone increasing wants.

#### (iii) Heavy Population Pressure
India is overpopulated, having grown more than three times since independence (350 million in 1947 to **1.21 billion** by the 2011 Census). India is the second most populous country after China.
*   More population means increased requirements for food, clothes, education, health services, houses, and roads, placing a huge burden on available government resources.
*   **Positive Aspect:** A high number of young people (about half of the population is in the 0 to 25 age group, and 78.5 crore people are below 35 years) indicates energy and strength, and a low dependency ratio.

#### (iv) Existence of Poverty
Nearly one-third of the world's poor live in India. Visuals of poverty include beggars, slums, and children working in street-side shops or factories.
*   By 2004–05, about **27.5% of the total population (more than 30 crore people)** suffered from poverty.
*   Odisha was the most affected by poverty by percentage (46%), while Uttar Pradesh (UP) had the maximum absolute number of poor people (590 lakh).
*   A poor person lacks basic necessities, cannot eat two square meals a day, wear proper clothes, or afford shelter, education, or healthcare. Poverty is caused by factors like unemployment, low income, exploitation based on caste/religion/gender, lack of inherited property, and obstacles like corruption and slow decision-making in the government.

#### (v) Dependence on Agriculture
The Indian economy has traditionally relied on agriculture.
*   At the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan in 1951, over 70% of the population was engaged in agriculture; even by 2001, around 60% of the population still depended on it.

#### (vi) Planning for Development
A major positive feature is the consistent effort to achieve development through **economic planning**. India adopted **Five-Year Plans**, starting with the first plan in 1951 (duration 1951–1956).
*   **Planning** involves systematic preparation to solve problems and achieve fixed targets, such as allocating resources (manpower, machinery, money) properly to minimize wastage.
*   Plans address problems like generating employment, improving the standard of living, providing safe water, and building infrastructure.
*   India occasionally had Annual Plans instead of Five-Year Plans (e.g., 1966–1969) due to a lack of resources caused by wars (1962, 1965) and drought.

## Part 2: Sectoral Aspects of the Indian Economy

People pursue different activities to earn their livelihood, which are classified into three major sectors: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary.

### 1. Primary Sector
This sector involves activities related to the direct utilization of natural resources, largely located in rural areas.
*   **Includes:** Agriculture and allied activities (cultivation of food and non-food items), fishery, forestry (collecting timber, herbal medicines), and mining and quarrying.
*   **Role and Importance:**
    1.  **Employment:** It is the occupation of the largest section of India’s population, employing about **50%** in 2009–10.
    2.  **Food Supply:** Essential for life, providing food (wheat, rice, pulses, etc.) to millions.
    3.  **Raw Materials:** Supplies raw materials to industries (e.g., sugar, jute, cotton textiles, food processing).
    4.  **National Income Share:** Contributed over 50% at independence, but this share fell to about **15%** in 2009–10.

### 2. Secondary Sector (Industry)
This sector includes non-agricultural production activities, typically found in urban areas.
*   **Includes:** Manufacturing, construction (buildings, roads, dams, bridges), and gas, water, and electricity supply.
*   **Types of Manufacturing:**
    *   **Small Scale Industry:** Requires a minimum investment of ₹25 lakh on plant and machinery and typically uses **labour-intensive technology** (more labour, less capital).
    *   **Large Scale Industry:** Requires a huge investment, spread over large areas, and uses **capital-intensive technology** (big machines).
*   **Role and Importance:**
    1.  **National Income Share:** Increased from 14% at independence to **28%** in 2009–10.
    2.  **Employment:** Provides employment opportunities, with small industries providing roughly 3.12 crore jobs out of 3.30 crore total industrial jobs.
    3.  **Infrastructure Creation:** Essential for building infrastructure such as roads, railways, dams (e.g., Hirakud), and communication towers.
    4.  **Consumer Goods:** Produces daily-use items like clothes, pens, shoes, cars, etc..

### 3. Tertiary Sector (Service Sector)
This sector is characterized by the provision of services, which are intangible.
*   **Includes:** Trade, Hotels and Restaurants, Transport, Storage and Communication, Financial services (Banking and Insurance), Real estate, Business services, and Public Administration.
*   **Role and Importance:**
    1.  **National Income Share:** This is the largest contributor, accounting for **55.2%** of India’s total national income in 2009–10. (Financial/Real Estate/Business services contributed the most, at 16.7%).
    2.  **Employment:** Absorbed **29.4%** of total employment in 2009–10, a figure expected to rise as educated people move away from agriculture.
    3.  **Attracting Foreign Funds:** The rapid growth of the service sector, particularly computer/IT services, attracts significant foreign direct investment.
    4.  **Exports:** Contributes heavily to exports, earning foreign exchange (e.g., through IT, consultancy, and legal services).

### 4. Linkages Among the Three Sectors
All three sectors are **interlinked** and complement and supplement each other.
*   **Industry and Services support Agriculture:** Agriculture requires industrial inputs (like pump sets, fertilizers, tractors). Services (transport, banking, communication) facilitate the movement of these inputs.
*   **Agriculture supports Industry and Services:** People working in industries and services get food supplied by the agricultural sector (e.g., a truck carries food items back to the industrial area).
*   **Service sector links them all:** Transport carries goods, mobile phones facilitate communication (e.g., tracking an order), and cheques deposited in banks are part of financial services, backed by money flow that enables the transactions.

## Part 3: Challenges of the Indian Economy

India faces several serious challenges in achieving welfare and development.

### 1. Tackling Poverty and Unemployment

#### (i) Defining the Poverty Line
The Planning Commission defines the **Poverty Line** based on minimum calorie intake from food. A person is considered poor if they are unable to obtain:
*   **2400 kcal per day** in rural areas.
*   **2100 kcal per day** in urban areas.
Based on this, about 27.5% of the population was poor in 2004–05.

#### (ii) Unemployment
The slow growth of industries, lack of education/training, and the seasonal nature of agriculture contribute to unemployment. India’s labour force (people aged 15 to 59 able to work) was over 43 crores by 2010. Daily unemployment affects about 3 to 4 crores (around 8%) of this force.

#### (iii) Employment and Poverty Alleviation Programmes
The government implements schemes to reduce poverty and create jobs:
1.  **The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS):** Aims to provide **at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment** in a year for unskilled manual work to rural households. Launched in 2006 (notified for the entire country in 2008).
2.  **Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY):** A self-employment scheme (Swarozgaris) launched in 1999. It provides training and bank loans to the rural poor, focusing primarily on SC, ST, and women.
3.  **Swarna Jayanti Sahari Rozgar Yojna (SJSRY):** Provides employment and training programmes for poor families living in urban areas.

### 2. Providing Education

The overall literacy rate of India was 74.04% in 2011. The government has taken steps to universalize education:
*   **Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009:** Makes free education for all children between 6 to 14 years of age a **fundamental right**.
*   **Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA):** Implemented in partnership with state governments to provide education to children aged 6–14 years. Goals include enrolment, retention, and closing gaps due to caste or gender.
*   **National Programme for Education for Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) and Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs):** Special components under SSA to provide education, uniforms, and residential schooling for girls.
*   **National Programme of Mid-day Meals in Schools:** Provides a healthy diet to attract and retain children in schools and develops a sense of belongingness among children from different societal sections.
*   **Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA):** Launched in 2009 to increase enrolment in the secondary stage.
*   **Saakshar Bharat:** Recast national literacy mission to promote literacy among adults above 15 years, focusing particularly on women.
*   **Higher and Technical Education:** Plans include establishing new universities, engineering colleges (NITs, IITs), and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs).

### 3. Providing Health Care

India faces major health challenges, evidenced by high Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), and Child Mortality Rate (CMR). The government spends very little on health care (only 1.27% of National Income).

*   **National Rural Health Mission (NRHM):** Launched in 2005 to provide **affordable and qualitative health services to the rural population**. It aims to strengthen public health delivery systems and eliminate diseases like malaria, TB, and leprosy. NRHM uses Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) to provide doorstep care.
*   **Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY):** Launched to save the life of the mother at the time of delivery.
*   **Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY):** Aims to remove regional imbalances in healthcare by constructing six new AIIMS-like institutions and upgrading 12 existing medical colleges.
*   **National AIDS Control:** Centers created to generate awareness and treat people affected by HIV, which affected about 24 lakh people in India in 2009.

### 4. Controlling Price Rise (Inflation)

Price rise (inflation) hits buyers badly because they must pay more money for the same goods, reducing their purchasing power.
*   **Causes of Price Rise:** Shortage of goods (due to inadequate production or wastage from poor storage) or **hoarding** (sellers deliberately storing goods secretly to create an artificial shortage and charge higher prices).
*   **Government Measures:** The government controls prices by helping farmers (e.g., subsidizing seeds and fertilizer), building store houses and cold storages to prevent wastage, and strictly punishing those found guilty of hoarding.

### 5. Achieving Higher Economic Growth
Economic growth is defined as the increase in a country’s total income and per capita income.
*   The government achieves this by encouraging the establishment of industries (small, large, and heavy), promoting the use of better inputs in agriculture, improving infrastructure (which helps the service sector), and implementing economic reforms.

## Part 4: Indian Economy in the Global Context

### 1. Economic Relationship and Trade

When economic activities (buying, selling, job seeking, investing) take place between the citizens of two or more countries, it is called an economic relationship. A country with such a relationship is called an **open economy**.

*   **International Trade:** Buying and selling goods and services between countries.
    *   **Exports:** Selling goods and services to foreign countries.
    *   **Imports:** Buying goods and services from foreign countries.

#### Importance of International Trade:
1.  **Variety of Goods:** People get a lot of varieties of domestic and foreign goods and services (e.g., foreign soft drinks, Indian pickles sold abroad).
2.  **Specialization and Efficiency:** Trade encourages specialization, allowing countries to produce goods at a better quality and lower cost (e.g., India specializing in spices or handicrafts due to better resources/culture).
3.  **Cultural Interaction:** People from different countries meet and interact through trade, learning about different cultures and traditions.

#### India’s Trade Partners and Items:
*   **Major Exports:** Engineering goods, handicrafts, chemicals, readymade garments, cotton yarn, iron ore, rice, fruits, and vegetables.
*   **Major Imports:** **Petroleum and lubricants** (most important item, imported from OPEC countries like Iran and UAE), non-ferrous metals, capital goods (machinery and transport equipment), and fertilizer.
*   **Trading Partners:** USA, China, UK, Germany, Iran, UAE, etc..

### 2. Globalization

**Globalization** is the process by which the world seems to be coming closer, facilitated by trade, transport, and revolutionary developments in communication (internet, mobile phones, television). This allows people to consume foreign goods, work abroad, and easily exchange ideas across borders.

### 3. Comparison of Economic Development (USA, China, India)

| Feature | USA (Developed) | China (Fast Developing) | India (Developing) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Political System** | Largest Democracy. | One-party rule (not a democracy). | Largest Democracy. |
| **Economic System** | Major role played by the private sector; minimal government interference. | Adopted economic reforms after the 1980s, allowing private sector business. | Mixed Economy with Planning (Five-Year Plans starting 1951). |
| **Growth & Income** | Most developed economy; US dollar is an international currency. | Second largest economy globally; faster growth in national and per capita income than India. | Slow growth of national and per capita income. |
| **Population Control** | N/A | Performing better than India in controlling population. | Expected to overtake China in population in the future. |
| **Poverty Ratio** | 16% of the population did not have access to good food in 2008. | Poverty fell drastically from 51% (1981) to **2.5% (2005)**. | Poverty ratio was **27.5% (2005)**. |
| **Foreign Investment** | American corporations (MNCs) have global influence (e.g., Coca Cola, Ford Motors). | Attracts significantly more foreign money toward industrialization and services than India. | Service sector attracts foreign funds due to growth. |
