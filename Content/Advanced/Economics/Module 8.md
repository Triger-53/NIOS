## Part 1: Environment and Sustainable Development

You have previously learned how economic development improves the quality of life by producing goods and services, which require both man-made and natural resources. However, this production process uses up resources and causes environmental problems.

### 1. The Environment: Definition and Significance

The environment encompasses all living and non-living things naturally occurring on Earth or within a specific region.

#### Components of the Environment
The environment is a study of the inter-relationship between two main components:

1.  **Biotic elements (Living):** Includes birds, animals, plants, forests, etc..
2.  **Abiotic elements (Non-living):** Includes air, water, rocks, sun, etc..

#### Significance of the Environment

The environment is important for several reasons:

*   **Provides Resources:** It provides resources classified as **renewable** and **non-renewable**.
    *   **Renewable Resources:** These resources are easily replenished over time and can be used without the possibility of being exhausted (e.g., trees in the forests, fishes in the ocean).
    *   **Non-renewable Resources:** These resources can get exhausted or depleted over time and must be used carefully, keeping future generations in mind (e.g., fossil fuels and minerals like petroleum, natural gas, coal, uranium-235).
*   **Absorbs Waste:** The environment assimilates harmful wastes and byproducts (like smoke from chimneys, vehicle exhaust, sewage, and industrial effluents). It cleans and recycles these waste products through natural processes.
*   **Sustains Life (Biodiversity):** The environment sustains life by creating genetic variations that allow life forms to adapt and evolve, even in harsh environments. Preserving the environment is crucial to preserve these life forms.
*   **Aesthetic Value:** It provides priceless scenery and landscapes that often play an important role in man's culture around the world.

### 2. Environmental Problems

The advance of human civilization and the expansion of human wants have led to rapid resource depletion and accompanying environmental problems, including pollution, degradation of natural resources, and depletion of non-renewable resources.

#### (i) Pollution
Pollution is an **undesirable change in the quality of a natural resource or ecosystem** that can adversely affect the health of living beings immediately or over a long time.

*   **Pollutant:** A waste material or substance that causes this undesirable change (e.g., smoke, dust, poisonous gases, industrial effluents, sewage).

| Type of Pollution | Sources (Artificial/Human) | Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Air Pollution** | Smoke from power plants/factories, exhaust from vehicles, chemicals (pesticides/fertilizers) from farming, waste deposition (methane). | Difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, aggravation of respiratory/cardiac conditions, premature death. |
| **Water Pollution** | Sewage discharge, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff (pesticides/fertilizers), oil spills, heated or radioactive water release. | Waterborne diseases (cholera, typhoid, diarrhea), alteration of water chemistry (acidity, temperature), killing aquatic life, disturbing food-cycle. |
| **Noise Pollution** | Vehicular traffic, industrial processes (sawing, crushing), construction work, household noises (stereos, appliances). | Annoyance, aggression, hypertension, high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular effects. |

#### (ii) Degradation
Degradation refers to the loss of normal quality or functioning of a natural resource.

*   **Soil Degradation:** An undesirable change or disturbance in the quality of the soil, leading to a loss of natural nutrients, minerals, and productivity.
    *   **Causes:** Excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, waterlogging from excessive irrigation, and overgrazing by animals.
    *   **Effects:** Significantly reduces crop yield potential, leads to groundwater pollution (heavy metals, toxins), loss of green cover, reduced biodiversity, and **desertification** (land converts into a desert unfit for cultivation).
*   **Habitat Degradation:** Habitats lose their ability to support native life due to human activities.
    *   **Causes:** Deforestation (for wood/timber), conversion of forest land to agricultural land, urban expansion, and slash-and-burn agriculture.
    *   **Effects:** Reduced carrying capacity for species, imbalance in the food chain/ecosystem, mass extinction of plants/animals, increased vulnerability to natural disasters (flood/drought), and adverse effects on valuable ecosystem services and aesthetic uses (like ecotourism).

#### (iii) Depletion of Resources
Resource depletion is the economic term for the **exhaustion of raw materials** in an area or region, primarily associated with farming, fishing, and mining.

*   **Crisis:** Resources essential to our lives (like petroleum, coal, uranium-235, and gold) are becoming increasingly difficult to find, driven by increased demand and significant human population growth.
*   **Consequence:** Over-exploitation causes environmental effects like global warming, pollution, and loss of biodiversity.

### 3. Sustainable Development

To combat the environmental crisis, the **careful usage of limited resources** is advocated, which is known as sustainable development.

*   **Definition:** **Sustainable development is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for generations to come**.
*   **Brundtland Report Definition:** “Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”.
*   **Long-Term Concept:** It does not narrowly focus only on present economic growth but considers future economic growth and emphasizes that the present use of natural resources should not limit their use in the future.

#### Ways to Achieve Sustainable Development

Achieving sustainable development requires swift and decisive action and thinking about development for the world as a whole, not just one community or country. This is done through:

1.  **Finding Substitutes:** Using renewable resources judiciously and finding substitutes for non-renewable ones (e.g., using solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, and biofuels like gobar gas instead of coal or oil).
2.  **Recycling:** Re-processing used products (e.g., recycling used paper to save trees; reusing rainwater through **rainwater harvesting**).
3.  **Reducing (Economizing):** Restraining consumption to basic needs (e.g., walking instead of driving, switching off unnecessary lights/fans).

## Part 2: Consumer Awareness

People purchase goods and services to satisfy their wants. However, if the purchased goods are of bad quality, unreasonably priced, or short in quantity, consumers feel cheated. The consumer awareness system aims to address these issues and ensure proper compensation for loss.

### 1. Key Definitions

*   **Consumer:** The **buyer of goods and services**. The user of goods and services with the buyer's permission is also treated as a consumer. However, a person purchasing goods for resale is **not** a consumer.
*   **Goods and Services:** **Goods** are manufactured or produced products sold through wholesalers and retailers. **Services** are facilities provided in connection with banking, finance, insurance, transport, health, entertainment, etc., but exclude services rendered free of charge or under a contract of personal service.
*   **Consumer Awareness:** The combination of knowledge regarding:
    *   The quality of the product (e.g., whether it is good for health or environmentally safe).
    *   Education about hazards associated with marketing (e.g., verifying contents of advertisements).
    *   Knowledge of **Consumer Rights** (right product, claiming compensation for faulty products).
    *   Knowledge of consumer’s own **Responsibilities** (avoiding wasteful consumption, supporting tax payment).

### 2. Need for Consumer Awareness

The vast number and variety of goods/services and the physical distance between consumers and producers (due to advanced technology like internet orders) make it difficult for consumers to know who a genuine seller is. The need for awareness arises because:

1.  **Misleading Information:** Producers often hide crucial information (like expiry dates on medicines/food) or use deceptive advertisements.
2.  **Tax Evasion (No Bill):** Sellers often deduct Value Added Tax (VAT) to attract consumers with a lower price, omitting the bill. The consumer does not ask for the bill because the price is less. This deprives the government of tax revenue, and the consumer cannot file a complaint or return a faulty product without proof of purchase.
3.  **Lack of Unity:** Producers are strong and organized through associations, while buyers are weak and unorganized, leading to consumers being duped and deceived.
4.  **Mindless Consumption:** Consumers need awareness about their responsibilities to avoid wasteful consumption, environmental pollution from waste disposal, and indirectly aiding tax evasion.

### 3. Consumer Redressal System in India

The consumer redressal system is the legal and administrative machinery enabling consumers to file a complaint and demand justice and compensation when cheated.

#### (i) Government Legislation
The most important law is the **Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (CPA)**, which is specifically designed to protect consumer interests.

*   **Objectives:** To provide **‘cheap’, ‘simple’, and ‘quick’ justice** to consumers. It involves less formality, paperwork, and expense.
*   **Scope:** CPA applies to **all goods and services** (private, public, and cooperative sectors) unless specifically exempted. Consumers can even sue municipal authorities for failure to provide services like drinking water and drainage.
*   **Recent Provisions:** Consumers can choose where to seek redressal, companies cannot insist on a court of their choice, and real estate developers are classified as traders and can be tried in consumer court.
*   **Foreign Agencies:** Oversees agencies operating via e-commerce or telemarketing must maintain an office in India and must organize inspection of goods or refund goods within 30 days to sell products.
*   *Other Acts:* Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA) 1954, Essential Commodities Act (ECA) 1955, and Standard of Weights and Measures Act (SWMA) 1976.

#### (ii) Institutional Machinery
India has a three-tiered system for consumer grievance redressal:

| Level | Government Council | Consumer Court (Quasi-Judicial) | Max Value of Complaint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **National Level (Apex)** | Central Consumer Protection Council (CCPC) | **National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC)** | Above ₹1 crore |
| **State Level (Mid)** | State Consumer Protection Council (SCPC) | **State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC)** (35 Commissions) | Up to ₹1 crore |
| **District Level (Bottom)** | N/A | **District Consumer Forum (DCF)** (604 Forums) | Up to ₹20 lakh |

*   **Filing a Complaint:** A written complaint can be filed by the affected consumer, a representative, or a lawyer, along with a nominal fee. The complaint must be filed **within 2 years** of the defect occurring. If the consumer is not satisfied with a lower court’s decision, they can appeal to a higher court within 30 days.
*   **Role of NGOs:** Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are crucial if sellers are unresponsive. They help file cases, provide support (logistic, manpower), and conduct programmes to educate consumers about their rights and responsibilities. The organization *Jago Grahak Jago* also assists consumers.

### 4. Consumers’ Rights

The purchase of goods and services entitles consumers to six fundamental rights:

1.  **Right to Information:** Consumers must be provided with enough information (price, weight, brand, expiry dates, quality marks, ingredients) to make informed choices.
2.  **Right to Choose:** Consumers have the right to choose what to buy and what not to buy, without being forced to purchase additional, unnecessary items.
3.  **Right to Safety:** Protection against the marketing of goods unsafe to health and life (e.g., adulteration in food, faulty medicines, electronics).
4.  **Right to be Heard:** Ensures that consumers’ interests are given consideration in appropriate forums, empowering them to fearlessly voice complaints against defective products or errant producers.
5.  **Right to Seek Redressal:** The right to get compensation for damage caused by unfair and exploitative trade practices (e.g., refund, replacement, or compensation).
6.  **Right to Consumer Education:** Access to programs and information (issued by government or NGOs) that help consumers make better decisions before and after purchase, often including authentication marks like ISI, AGMARK, and BIS.

### 5. Consumers’ Responsibilities

Consumers must act responsibly and sincerely:

1.  **Dealing with Advertisements:** Consumers must be cautious of deceptive advertisements, as companies often hide crucial information.
2.  **Buying Quality Certified Products:** Consumers should choose products with quality assurance seals like **ISI mark** (for consumer goods) and **AGMARK** (for food products). They must also check the expiry date.
3.  **Demanding Bill:** Every consumer must demand a bill (cash memo or receipt) as proof of purchase for filing complaints and to ensure the seller pays the mandatory tax (VAT) to the government.
4.  **Being a Green Consumer:** Consumers should consume products that do not damage the environment, use biodegradable products, and save electricity and gas. They should avoid plastic bags and use public transport to reduce pollution.
5.  **Consumers as Managers:** Consumers can unite (e.g., in village *Pani Samitis* in Gujarat) to manage the delivery of basic services like water supply, reducing cost, improving efficiency, and conserving resources.

### 6. Challenges of Consumer Movement in India

The consumer movement faces significant challenges:

1.  **Spreading Awareness in Rural India:** Rural consumers are often ignorant and illiterate, making them easy targets for exploitation (fake brands, spurious products, unreasonable pricing, lack of warranties). Spreading awareness in these areas is a major, serious task.
2.  **Timely Delivery of Justice:** Justice delayed is justice denied. While consumer courts are meant to be quick, delays occur due to repeated adjournments, government delays in filling judge posts, and unnecessary technicalities. The CPA was amended in 2003 to require courts to avoid adjournments or record reasons for them in writing to speed up the process.
