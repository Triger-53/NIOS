## Part 1: Collection and Presentation of Data

### 1. Meaning and Features of Data (Statistics)

**Data** means quantitative information providing facts in an aggregate manner. This information must be numerical and useful for decision-making. It is also called statistical data or simply statistics. The term 'data' is plural, and its singular form is 'datum'.

Key features of data (or statistics):

*   **Aggregate of facts:** A single fact cannot be considered data. For example, one student scoring 95 marks is a fact, but the marks of all students in a class constitute **data** because it is an aggregate of facts, providing scope for analysis and comparison (e.g., comparing class performance).
*   **Numerically expressed:** Data must be quantitative. Qualitative information (like "good," "bad," or "handsome") cannot be quantified and is not considered data. Facts must be put into a framework of numbers through counting, calculation, or estimation.
*   **Affected by multiplicity of causes:** Data are not influenced by a single factor but by many factors. For instance, a rise in prices might be due to reduced supply, increased demand, higher taxes, or rising wages.
*   **Reasonable standard of accuracy:** **100% accuracy is neither possible nor desirable** in statistics; only a reasonable standard of accuracy is required and expected.
*   **Predetermined purpose:** Data are collected for a specific, predetermined purpose. For example, collecting marks data helps evaluate student performance.

### 2. Importance of Data in Economics

Data is essential in several specific areas of economic study:

1.  **Economic Planning:** Data from previous years (e.g., student enrollment and past expenditure) are used to prepare future plans and forecasting (e.g., predicting the growth of per capita income requires data on population and national income growth rates).
2.  **Determining National Income:** Knowing the state of the economy requires calculating national income, which demands quantitative information on wages, salaries, rent, interest, and profit earned in the economy.
3.  **Basis of Government Policies:** Governments widely use statistical data to frame economic development policies. For example, data on poverty and unemployment led to policies like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. Data from the Census (on male/female population ratios) informs policies aimed at social issues like saving the girl child.

### 3. Types and Sources of Data

Data is classified based on the source of collection: **Primary data** and **Secondary data**.

#### (a) Primary Data
Primary data are those which are **originally collected for the first time** for the purpose of a specific survey.

**Methods of Collecting Primary Data:**
*   **Direct personal investigation:** The investigator personally collects data from the respondent. This data is highly reliable, but the results may be influenced by the investigator's personal bias.
*   **Indirect investigations:** Information is obtained indirectly from a third person who is expected to know facts about the subject of inquiry. This is often used by government commissions.
*   **Through correspondent:** Correspondents or agents are appointed to collect and transmit information to a central office. This is widely used by newspaper offices.
*   **By mailed questionnaire:** A questionnaire is prepared and mailed to the respondent to fill and return. This method only works if the respondents are literate.
*   **Through schedules:** Field workers use a schedule (a list of questions) to collect answers in their own handwriting. This method is useful when the respondent is illiterate.

#### (b) Secondary Data
Secondary data are data that have **already been collected by others** and are being used by a new party. Data is primary for the original collector, and secondary for all other users.

**Sources of Secondary Data:**
*   **Published form:** Reports of newspapers, the RBI, periodicals, trade associations, financial data in annual reports, official publications, and publications of international bodies (like UNO, World Bank).
*   **Unpublished form:** Internal reports of government departments, records maintained by institutions, and research reports prepared by university students.

### 4. Classification and Tabulation of Data

Raw data must be organized to become meaningful.

*   **Classification:** This is the process of arranging raw data into classes or groups according to their resemblances.
*   **Variable vs. Attribute:**
    *   **Variable:** Data capable of being classified by magnitude (time or size), such as height, weight, or length.
        *   **Discrete Variable:** Has a specific, measurable value and cannot be broken into fractions (e.g., number of children per family).
        *   **Continuous Variable:** Has continuity in its scale and measurement and is usually placed in a continuous series (e.g., height, weight).
    *   **Attribute:** Data that cannot be classified by magnitude, such as beauty, bravery, or intelligence. Attributes are difficult to investigate deeply.
*   **Statistical Series:** Data can be organized into three types of series:
    *   **Individual series:** Items are shown individually with their corresponding value. If arranged in ascending or descending order, it is called an **array**.
    *   **Discrete Series:** Shows variables with definite breaks alongside their respective **frequencies** (how frequently a value appears).
    *   **Continuous Series:** Groups variables into ranges (e.g., 10-20, 20-30) with corresponding frequencies.
*   **Tabulation:** After classification, data is organized into rows and columns in a statistical table. This provides a systematic presentation.

### 5. Diagrammatic and Graphic Presentation

Data can be presented visually for easier comprehension.

*   **Diagrammatic Presentation:** A geometrical version of the data. **Bar diagrams** are commonly used **one-dimensional diagrams**, where only the height (not the width) is relevant. Bars must have uniform thickness and be placed at equal distances.
*   **Graphic Presentation:** Data relating to time series or frequency distribution is presented in a graph, often a line or curve. In a time series graph, the x-axis typically represents time, and the y-axis represents the variable.

## Part 2: Analysis of Dataâ€”Measures of Central Tendency

Once data is collected, organized, and presented, it must be analyzed. Statistical methods are used to study economic data, and statistics itself is a scientific subject that is descriptive and conclusive.

### 1. Meaning of Central Tendency and Average

The first step in data analysis is to find a single, representative value that describes the characteristics of the whole data set.

*   **Central Tendency:** This is the tendency of data to **cluster towards the central location or value**.
*   **Average (or Mean):** The most representative figure extracted from the raw data. This single value is the point around which individual items cluster.
    *   *Example:* If Sachin's scores in five innings average 70 runs, 70 is the representative figure, even though he might not have scored exactly 70 in any single inning.

### 2. Purpose and Functions of Averages

Averages serve several important functions in descriptive statistics:
*   To convert collected information and raw data into a brief form.
*   To facilitate comparison between two or more groups.
*   To present a representative value from raw data.
*   To facilitate future policy and programme development.

### 3. Arithmetic Mean

The arithmetic mean (or average) is a mathematical average and a widely used measure of central tendency.

#### (i) Calculation in Individual Series
The arithmetic mean ($\bar{X}$) is obtained by dividing the sum of the items ($\Sigma x$) by the number of items ($N$):

$$\bar{X} = \frac{\Sigma x}{N}$$

**Alternative Method (Shortcut Method):** For complex individual data, an assumed mean ($A$) can be used:

$$\bar{X} = A + \frac{\Sigma dx}{N}$$

Where $dx$ is the deviation of each item ($x$) from the assumed mean ($A$).

#### (ii) Calculation in Discrete Series
Discrete series includes frequencies ($f$) corresponding to each item ($x$).

*   **Direct Method:** $$\bar{X} = \frac{\Sigma fx}{N}$$
    Where $N$ is the sum of frequencies ($\Sigma f$).
*   **Shortcut Method:** $$\bar{X} = A + \frac{\Sigma fdx}{N}$$
   .

#### (iii) Calculation in Continuous Series
Continuous series groups variables into classes (e.g., 0-10, 10-20). First, the **mid-value** ($x$) of each class must be calculated ($\frac{L_1 + L_2}{2}$), where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are the lower and upper limits.

Three methods can be used:
*   **Direct Method:** $$\bar{X} = \frac{\Sigma fx}{N}$$.
*   **Shortcut Method (Without Step Deviation):** $$\bar{X} = A + \frac{\Sigma fdx}{N}$$.
*   **Shortcut Method (With Step Deviation):** $$\bar{X} = A + \frac{\Sigma fdx'}{N} \times c$$
}{2}$), where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are the lower and upper limits.

Three methods can be used:
*   **Direct Method:** $$\bar{X} = \frac{\Sigma fx}{N}$$.
*   **Shortcut Method (Without Step Deviation):** $$\bar{X} = A + \frac{\Sigma fdx}{N}$$.
*   **Shortcut Method (With Step Deviation):** $$\bar{X} = A + \frac{\Sigma fdx'}{N} \times c$$
    Where $c$ is the common factor.

### 4. Precautions When Using Arithmetic Mean

It is important to remember two major limitations of the arithmetic mean:

1.  **Theoretical Value:** The arithmetic mean is a theoretical value and may not be represented by an actual fact. For instance, an average of 2.7 children per family is unrealistic, as there can only be 2 or 3 actual children.
2.  **Qualitative Data:** The arithmetic mean cannot be calculated for qualitative data (attributes) such as honesty, bravery, loyalty, or beauty.
