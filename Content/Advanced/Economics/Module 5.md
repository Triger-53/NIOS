## Part 1: Money, Barter, and the Need for a New System

### 1. The Role of Money

Money plays a crucial role in modern, busy life. We use money to buy various goods and to avail ourselves of services such as transport, education, health, and entertainment. As a buyer, you pay money; as a seller, you receive money, usually in the form of paper currency and coins.

### 2. The Barter System (The Historical Precursor)

In ancient days, before money was invented, people used to exchange good for good; this was known as the **barter system**.

*   **Definition:** Barter system means the exchange of one kind of goods and services for another kind of goods and services, with **no involvement of money**.
*   **Examples:** In ancient civilizations, traders from Europe might exchange goods like fur for silk from the Eastern part of the world. Families in tribal societies might exchange labour services (e.g., harvesting a crop) in return for food or other labour services (e.g., roofing a house).

### 3. The Failure of the Barter System (Demerits)

As human civilization progressed, the barter system became impractical due to several major problems, leading to the need for money:

1.  **Lack of Double Coincidence of Wants:** This was a common problem. For an exchange to occur, if person A wants cloth and has rice, the person who has cloth (person B) must also be willing to exchange it for rice. If person B does not want rice, the exchange will not take place. This forced people to spend a lot of time searching for someone ready to exchange, a difficult task given the lack of proper transport and communication.
2.  **Lack of Division of Goods:** Certain goods were not physically divisible into small pieces. For example, if a person owned a cow and wanted cloth and food grains, it was difficult and absurd to determine how much of the cow should be traded for a specific amount of grain, as a cow cannot be divided.
3.  **Lack of Common Unit of Measurement:** Because goods lacked divisibility, it was difficult to equate the values of different traded goods. No single good (like a cow) could become a common measure of value.
4.  **Problem of Storage:** A person had to store a large volume of their own good in order to exchange it for desired items on a day-to-day basis. A farmer, for instance, needed to construct and maintain a warehouse to stock wheat for trading, which was a very difficult task.
5.  **Lack of Store of Value:** Many goods (like salt or vegetables) are perishable. They lose their original quality and value if stored for a long time. Hence, they were never accepted for trading in the future and could not be used for the purpose of lending and borrowing.

The failure of barter prompted society to discover money—a common medium that can be easily carried, stored, and used to express value.

### 4. Definition and Functions of Money

**Money** is defined as something which is generally accepted by society as a medium of exchange and which can act as a unit of account, store value, and be used for the repayment of debt.

Money performs four fundamental functions:

1.  **Medium of Exchange:** This is the primary function. Money allows people to easily buy or sell goods and services; the buyer pays money, and the seller receives it.
2.  **Measure of Value (Unit of Account):** Money serves as a common measure of value. The value of a good (Price $\times$ Quantity) is determined and expressed in monetary terms.
3.  **Store of Value:** Money has purchasing power, meaning that the value of the good you sold is stored in the money you receive. Unlike perishable commodities, money can be stored and retains its value.
4.  **Standard of Deferred Payment:** Money facilitates lending and borrowing. When an arrangement is made to settle a payment (loan plus interest) at some future date, this future payment is acceptable only in money, as it holds its value over time.

## Part 2: Saving and Interest

### 1. Meaning and Need for Saving

**Saving** is a very important economic activity.

*   **Definition:** Saving is the amount of income which is carried forward to the future after meeting current expenditure on goods and services. It is the **surplus of income over consumption**: $\text{Saving} = \text{Income} - \text{Consumption}$.
*   **Need and Usefulness of Saving:**
    1.  **Security for Future:** Saving provides a kind of security for future uncertainties, such as illness, allowing a person to sustain themselves until they can earn again.
    2.  **Increase in Future Income:** Saving increases the future income of a person, as they start the next period with an extra surplus.
    3.  **Lending and Borrowing:** Saved money allows the saver to become a **lender** (the person who gives money on loan). The surplus money can be used by others (borrowers) who want to consume more than their present income allows.
    4.  **Economic Development:** When many individuals save money, the collective large amount becomes available to the society for building essential infrastructure like roads, railway stations, and schools, thus contributing to the development of the economy.

### 2. Institutions for Keeping Savings

Money needs a secured place and should not be left idle. Savings can be kept in two main institutions:

*   **Post Office Savings Bank:** This is often close to reach. Any citizen can open an account with a minimum deposit (e.g., Rs. 50), and the post office provides a passbook. A nominal rate of interest (around 3.5% per year) is paid on savings.
*   **Commercial Banks:** Commercial banks accept deposits from the public. Like post offices, they provide a passbook detailing transactions and offer a nominal rate of interest (around 4% per year).

### 3. Interest as Return on Saving

When a person uses their saving to earn money, this return is called **Interest**.

*   The lender charges the borrower money for the use of the saving (loan amount).
*   **Rate of interest** is defined as the earning by the lender (or payment by the borrower) for the use of every 100 Rupees given for a period of one year.
*   When money is saved in a bank or post office, it grows to a higher amount tomorrow due to the interest earned.

## Part 3: Banking and Credit

### 1. The Bank and Banking Functions

A **Bank** is an institution that accepts money from the public as deposits and gives loans to them. **Banking** refers to accepting deposits from the public for the purpose of lending or investment, payable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawable by cheque, draft, or order.

The primary functions of a bank are:

1.  **Accepting Deposits:** Banks accept monetary deposits from individuals and firms, opening accounts and issuing account numbers. Banks generally give interest on certain types of deposits. They also issue **cheque books** to depositors for withdrawing money or making payments.
2.  **Giving Loans:** Banks provide loans to the public to satisfy present needs (e.g., buying expensive items like cars or houses) or to start a business, provided the borrower has the ability to repay the loan in the future.

An additional function is providing a **locker facility** for keeping valuable items like jewellery and property documents in safe custody.

### 2. The Concept of Credit

**Credit** is defined as the claim to receive payments. When a bank gives a loan, it becomes the lender and can claim the money (plus interest) back from the borrower in the future. Credit is created through the act of **lending and borrowing**.

### 3. The Process of Credit Creation

A bank cannot keep all deposits idle; it uses a fraction to give loans, thereby expanding its deposits through credit creation.

*   **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):** This is the fraction (in percentage term) of the total deposit that the bank must keep in the form of cash to make payments to people who come to withdraw money. The CRR is decided by the banking authority.
*   **Lending and Secondary Deposits:** The bank deducts the CRR amount from a new deposit and uses the rest to give a loan. This loan immediately creates a new deposit (a secondary deposit) in the banking system, and the process repeats.
*   **Total Credit Creation Formula:** The total credit created depends on the initial deposit and the CRR.
    $$\text{Total Credit} = \text{Initial Increase in Deposit} \times \frac{1}{\text{Cash Reserve Ratio}} \text{}$$
*   **Credit Capacity:** The capacity of a bank to create credit is **inversely related** to the Cash Reserve Ratio. If the CRR is higher, less money is available for loans, and less credit will be created.

## Part 4: Types of Money and Banks in India

### 1. Types of Money (Paper Currency and Coins)

The form of money has changed over centuries (from gold/silver coins, cattle, or salt). Now, people use paper notes and coins, which are easy to carry.

*   In India, currency notes (Rupees, `₹`) are in denominations up to Rs. 1000, and coins up to Rs. 10 are in circulation.
*   The currency notes and coins are guaranteed by the Government of India.

### 2. Types of Banks in India

The banking system in India is structured with the following types of banks:

1.  **Reserve Bank of India (RBI):** The **Central Bank** of the country and the head of the entire banking system.
    *   **Functions:** RBI issues currency notes (denominations Rs. 2, 5, 10, up to 1000), which bear the signature of the RBI Governor. It also acts as the banker to the government, taking deposits and giving loans to the Central and State Governments. (Note: One Rupee notes and coins are issued by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India).
2.  **Commercial Banks:** These are the primary institutions for deposits and loans. They aim to earn profit by charging interest on loans.
    *   They are categorized into **Public Sector Banks** (e.g., State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank) and **Private Sector Banks** (e.g., ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank).
3.  **Cooperative Banks:** Run by cooperative societies, these banks provide credit mainly based on geographical area and type of activity.
    *   In **rural areas**, they provide credit for farming, cattle, and fishery.
    *   In **urban areas**, they provide credit for self-employment, durable goods purchases, and personal finance.
4.  **Development Banks:** These banks provide **long-period credit** to private business companies and public sector units to establish industries and create infrastructure, helping achieve economic development.

## Part 5: Insurance

### 1. The Need for Insurance

We live in a world of **uncertainty** (we do not know what will happen in the future). Uncertainty involves the **risk of loss or damage** to life, health, or property (e.g., drought, fire, illness, accidents). Insurance provides a mechanism to receive compensation for these losses.

### 2. Definition and Roles

**Insurance** is defined as a financial product that can be purchased to partly or fully recover any loss happening due to an event beyond the control of the insured party.

Key roles in insurance:

*   **Insurer:** The seller of insurance (usually an insurance company).
*   **Insured:** The buyer of insurance.
*   **Premium:** The money paid by the insured to the insurer, typically for a specified number of years.
*   **Insurance Claim:** If a loss occurs, the insurance company pays back some amount of money to compensate the insured.

### 3. Types of Insurance Products

Insurance products protect against different types of financial risk:

1.  **Life Insurance:** A person pays a certain amount of premium yearly for a fixed time period (e.g., 10 or 25 years). The claim is given back to the person after the period is over, or to their nominee if the person dies during that time.
2.  **Health Insurance:** The insured pays a nominal annual premium. If the insured person falls ill and incurs medical expenditure, the insurance company provides an amount to reduce the burden of the cost.
3.  **Auto Insurance:** Purchased for durable goods like scooters, bikes, and cars. The premium is usually higher in the first year (when the vehicle is new) and decreases in subsequent years as the vehicle's value falls. The company provides the claim whenever damage is caused to the automobile, based on policy terms.
