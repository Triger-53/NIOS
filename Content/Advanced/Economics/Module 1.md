## Part 1: Understanding Economics

Economics is an extremely important subject within social science. In our daily lives, we constantly encounter economic concepts and make economic decisions, such as buying goods, setting prices, budgeting income, and observing national economic conditions like inflation and banking.

It is difficult to give a single, precise definition of economics because its scope is very large and has changed over time with the development of civilization.

### 1. The Evolution of the Meaning of Economics

Historically, scholars have viewed economics in five major ways:

#### (i) Science of Wealth
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, classical thinkers believed economics dealt primarily with the phenomenon of **wealth**. This perspective focused on the nature and causes of wealth and how individuals and nations created it.

#### (ii) Science of Welfare
A limitation of the wealth definition was that it ignored people without wealth, dividing society into the rich and the poor. To address this, early nineteenth-century scholars defined economics as the **science of welfare**.
Welfare includes both qualitative (like peace and leisure) and quantitative aspects (like consumption and increase in per capita income). As a science, economics was mainly concerned with **quantitative welfare** because it can be measured in terms of money.

#### (iii) Science of Scarcity and Choice
The welfare definition focused only on material aspects, but people desire both material goods and non-material services. The crucial realization is that resources available to any individual or society are **scarce (limited)**.
Because resources are limited and have alternative uses, individuals and societies must **make choices** to achieve their goals.

*   **Ends** imply "wants," and **Scarce Means** imply "limited resources".
*   For example, if an economy uses limited resources to produce both cloth and wheat, producing more wheat requires withdrawing resources from cloth production, causing cloth output to fall. Economics studies how to solve this problem with limited resources.

#### (iv) Science of Growth and Development
In the twentieth century, the focus expanded to include achieving **growth and development for the entire economy**. Economics is treated as the science of growth and development because it deals with the production and consumption of commodities over time, ensuring the economy grows and finds mechanisms to distribute benefits among citizens.

#### (v) Science of Sustainable Development
More recently, economists have focused on the **welfare of future generations** and **protection of the natural environment**. Economics is seen as the science of Sustainable Development, advocating for the judicious and efficient use of available scarce resources to prevent depletion (like minerals and forests) by the present generation.

### 2. Branches of Economics

The study of economics is generally divided into two distinct branches:

| Branch | Meaning | Focus Area | Examples of Study |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micro Economics** | "Micro" means very small. | Deals with economic decision-making by **single individuals, households, or firms**. | Determining the price of a good in the market; how an individual decides the quantity of goods to buy to maximize satisfaction; how a producer combines factors to achieve maximum output at minimum cost. |
| **Macro Economics** | "Macro" means very large. | Deals with economic aggregates and decisions taken at the level of the **entire economy, society, or country**. | Government policies on taxes and welfare; aggregate consumption expenditure or **national income**; the study of **inflation** (price rise); problems of unemployment and economic growth. |

### 3. Positive vs. Normative Economics

Economic study involves two different aspects: understanding what is happening and prescribing what should be done.

*   **Positive Economics**: Talks about "**What is**" or what might happen. It describes a phenomenon or states an economic fact.
    *   *Example:* "India has a large number of poor people".
*   **Normative Economics**: Talks about "**What ought to be**" or "**what should be**". It gives value judgments and prescribes actions that would benefit society.
    *   *Example:* "The government should spend more on education".

## Part 2: Understanding Human Wants

In economics, people are engaged in activities to earn income because they need to satisfy their many wants.

### 1. Meaning of Wants

It is human nature to have many wishes or desires (e.g., desiring a car, good food, or a computer). However, **not all desires can be met** because money is needed to satisfy them.

A **want** is a desire for a good or service that is **backed by money (purchasing power) and the willingness to purchase**.

*   *Example:* A beggar may desire a car, but this is only a desire because they lack the money. If a rich person desires a car and is willing to buy it, that desire becomes an economic want.

### 2. How Wants Arise and Grow

Wants are a part of living and arise with the birth of man. Historically, wants were limited (related to food, shelter, clothing). Over time, wants have grown and expanded tremendously due to discoveries (like fire, leading to new food items) and increasing knowledge, taste, and fashion.

Wants are generally classified by necessity:

1.  **Basic Wants or Necessities**: Essential for the existence of life (e.g., food, clothing, shelter).
2.  **Comforts**: Wants that make life easy and comfortable (e.g., coolers, a scooter).
3.  **Luxuries**: Costly goods that give pleasure (e.g., luxurious cars, diamond jewellery).

### 3. Characteristics of Wants

Human wants have several defining characteristics:

*   **Wants are unlimited**: Human wants are countless, and as soon as one want is satisfied, another immediately takes its place. This is an endless circle throughout life (e.g., satisfying the desire for a fan leads to desiring an air cooler, then an air conditioner, etc.).
*   **A single want is satiable**: While the total number of wants is unlimited, each specific want, taken separately, can be satisfied. For example, a thirsty person can satisfy their need by drinking a limited amount of water.
*   **Wants recur**: Many wants arise again and again after a certain period, even after being satisfied once (e.g., hunger and thirst).
*   **Wants vary**: Wants change based on time (medicine needed only when sick), place (woollens needed in Srinagar), and person. They are also influenced by factors like income, fashion, and economic development.
*   **Present wants are generally more important than future wants**: People tend to use their limited resources to satisfy current, urgent wants rather than worrying extensively about the uncertain future (e.g., prioritizing present education for children over future old age security).
*   **Wants change and expand with development**: As a country develops, wants multiply and evolve (e.g., moving from simple telephones to mobile phones with advanced facilities like cameras and internet).

### 4. Wants and Resources: The Scarcity Problem

Wants are satisfied using goods and services, which are produced with **resources** (land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship).

The critical issue is that wants are unlimited, but the **resources available to satisfy them are limited/scarce**. This scarcity is why not all wants can be fulfilled.

### 5. Economic vs. Non-Economic Wants

Wants are satisfied differently depending on whether they require payment:

*   **Economic Wants**: Satisfied by goods and services that are purchased from the market by **paying a price** (e.g., buying a book, hiring a maid to cook).
*   **Non-Economic Wants**: Satisfied by things that are **not purchased** from the market by paying a price, often provided due to natural abundance or affection (e.g., air to breathe, rain water for agriculture, or food cooked by one's mother).

(Note: The Indian philosophy, advocated by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, suggests limiting one's wants. By keeping wants limited, a person can satisfy most of them with limited resources, leading to greater satisfaction and a happier life).

## Part 3: Goods and Services

Human wants are unlimited, but they are satisfied by consuming **goods and services**.

### 1. Distinction Between Goods and Services

| Feature | Goods | Services |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | **Tangible** (can be seen and touched). | **Non-tangible** (cannot be seen or touched). |
| **Production/Consumption** | There is a **time gap** between production and consumption (produced first, consumed later). | Are **produced and consumed simultaneously** (no time gap). |
| **Storage** | Can be stored and utilized later. | Cannot be stored. |
| **Transfer** | Can be transferred from one person/place to another. | Transfer is not possible. |
| *Example* | A chair (seen, stored, transferred). | A doctor treating a patient (consumed the moment it is delivered). |

### 2. Classification of Goods and Services

Goods and services are classified into different broad groups to understand their economic significance:

#### (i) Free Goods and Economic Goods
This classification is based on scarcity:

*   **Free Goods**: Free gifts of nature, available in **unlimited quantity (abundance)**, and their supply is much more than the demand. They possess utility but are **not scarce** and do not command a price. (e.g., Sand in a desert, air to breathe).
*   **Economic Goods**: Goods (man-made or natural gifts) whose **demand is more than their supply**, meaning they are **scarce**. They **command a price** and can be bought in the market. (e.g., bread, minerals, cars, toothpaste).

Similarly, there are **Free Services** (rendered out of love/affection, like services of parents) and **Economic Services** (can be bought in the market, like services of doctors or engineers).

#### (ii) Consumer Goods and Producer Goods
This classification is based on the purpose of use:

*   **Consumer Goods**: Satisfy the want of the consumer **directly** and are used for final consumption (e.g., bread, clothes, milk).
*   **Producer Goods**: Satisfy consumer wants **indirectly** because they help in producing other goods (e.g., machinery, tools, raw materials). Raw materials and fuels used for further production are also called intermediate goods.

The same distinction applies to services (**Consumer Services**, like a tailor stitching your shirt directly; and **Producer Services**, like a truck transporting raw material to a factory).

#### (iii) Single Use and Durable Use Goods
This classification is based on how many times a good can be used:

*   **Single Use Goods**: Used only once and are finished in that single use (e.g., milk, butter, raw material like sugarcane used in sugar production).
*   **Durable Use Goods**: Can be used **again and again for a long period of time** (e.g., television, scooter, furniture; or machines and tractors in the case of producer goods).

#### (iv) Private Goods and Public Goods
This is based on ownership:

*   **Private Goods**: Privately owned and **exclusively enjoyed by individuals** (e.g., your pen, watch, private factory machinery).
*   **Public Goods**: Owned and enjoyed by the **society as a whole**. They are available to all people without discrimination (e.g., roads, parks, bridges).

### 3. Role and Significance in an Economy

Goods and services play a crucial, multi-dimensional role:

1.  **Satisfaction of Human Wants**: Increasing the availability of goods and services satisfies more of the unlimited human wants.
2.  **Production**: The availability of consumer goods depends directly on the increased availability and quality of **producer goods and services** (like better machinery, raw material, and banking services).
3.  **Investment**: Production is either consumed or saved. Whatever is *not* consumed is used for further production, resulting in **capital formation and investment** in the economy. Higher production generally leads to higher consumption and higher investment, increasing the economy’s productive capacity.
