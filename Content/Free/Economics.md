## Module 1: Understanding the Fundamentals of Economics

### 1. What is Economics?

Economics is a social science discipline that has taken on great importance. Historically, the meaning of economics has been modified and changed over time.

#### Historical Views on the Meaning of Economics

1.  **Science of Wealth:** Early scholars (late eighteenth and early nineteenth century classical thinkers) believed economics deals with the phenomenon of **wealth**, including its nature, causes, and creation by individuals and nations. A major criticism was that this definition ignored people who had no wealth.
2.  **Science of Welfare:** Recognizing the limitations of the wealth definition, later scholars suggested economics should address the **welfare of society**. This view focused on quantitative welfare, measurable in terms of money, such as consumption of goods and services or increase in per capita income.
3.  **Science of Scarcity and Choice:** This perspective arose because resources available to any individual or society are **scarce (limited)**, yet people desire both material goods and non-material services (unlimited wants, or "ends"). Since resources have alternative uses (e.g., land can grow wheat or cloth), people must **make choices**. This definition views economics as the study of human behaviour regarding the relationship between unlimited wants and scarce means that have alternative uses.
4.  **Science of Growth and Development:** In the twentieth century, the objective expanded to include achieving **growth and development** of the entire economy. The scope grew beyond individual decision-making to include the production and consumption of commodities over time, aiming for overall economic performance, efficient resource use, and equitable distribution of benefits among citizens.
5.  **Science of Sustainable Development:** More recently (late twentieth century), economists began focusing on the welfare of **future generations** and the protection of the **natural environment**. This emphasizes the judicious, efficient use of available scarce resources today to ensure resources remain for future generations, preventing the rapid depletion of items like minerals, mineral oil, and forests.

#### Branches of Economics

The study of economics is generally divided into two distinct branches:

| Branch | Meaning | Subject Matter (Study Level) | Examples of Questions Studied |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micro Economics** | "Micro" means very small. | Individual decision-making units, such as a single consumer, firm, or market. | How an individual buyer decides the quantity of a good to purchase for maximum satisfaction; how a seller determines the quantity to supply to maximize profit; how the price of a good is determined in the market. |
| **Macro Economics** | "Macro" means very large. | The economy as a whole, dealing with economic aggregates. | How government policies affect the whole society (e.g., tax collection and public expenditure); the study of aggregates like national income and total consumption expenditure; understanding the causes, effects, and control of **inflation** or **unemployment**. |

#### Positive vs. Normative Economics

Economics involves both understanding events and prescribing solutions.

*   **Positive Economics:** This deals with "What is" or what might happen, focusing on economic facts and figures. This describes a phenomenon that is occurring.
    *   *Example:* India has a large number of poor people.
*   **Normative Economics:** This deals with "What ought to be" or "what should be," providing value judgments and telling us what the right thing to do is.
    *   *Example:* The government should spend more on education.

## Module 2: Human Wants and Basic Economic Activities

### 2. Human Wants

Wants are central to economics because they drive human activity.

*   A **desire** becomes a **want** only when it is **backed by money (capacity to pay)** and the **willingness to purchase**. A beggar may desire a car, but this is not a want because it lacks the necessary money.
*   **Characteristics of Wants:**
    1.  **Unlimited:** Wants are countless and varied; as soon as one is satisfied, another takes its place, creating an endless circle throughout life.
    2.  **A Single Want is Satiable:** Although wants are unlimited collectively, each individual want (like thirst or hunger) can be fully satisfied at a specific point in time.
    3.  **Recur:** Most wants arise again and again after a certain period (e.g., hunger, thirst).
    4.  **Varying Nature:** Wants change with time, place, person, income, customs, fashion, and advertisement.
    5.  **Expand with Development:** With development (e.g., technological advances like mobile phones), new goods are invented, and wants change and expand (e.g., wanting a simple telephone evolves into wanting a mobile phone with internet and camera facilities).

*   **Classification by Necessity:**
    *   **Necessities (Basic Wants):** Required for the existence of life (e.g., food, clothing, shelter).
    *   **Comforts:** Make life easy and comfortable (e.g., coolers, scooters).
    *   **Luxuries:** Give pleasure but are satisfied by costly goods (e.g., luxurious cars, diamond jewellery).
*   **Classification by Payment:**
    *   **Economic Wants:** Satisfied by goods and services purchased from the market by **paying a price** (e.g., hiring a maid to cook).
    *   **Non-Economic Wants:** Satisfied by things **not purchased** from the market (e.g., air to breathe, rain water, food cooked by mother).

### 3. Goods and Services

Human wants are satisfied by consuming goods and services.

| Feature | Goods | Services |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | **Tangible** (can be seen and touched). | **Non-tangible** (can neither be seen nor touched).
| **Storage** | Can be stored and utilized later. | Cannot be stored.
| **Time Gap** | There is a time gap between production and consumption (produced first, consumed later). | Production and consumption take place **simultaneously** (no time gap).
| **Transferability** | Can be transferred from one place/person to another. | Transfer of service is not possible.

**Classification of Economic Goods and Services**:

| Type | Definition / Purpose | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Consumer Goods/Services** | Satisfy the want of the consumer **directly**. | Bread, milk, fruits, a tailor stitching your shirt. |
| **Producer Goods/Services** | Satisfy the want of consumers **indirectly** by helping in the production of other goods. | Machinery, raw materials, seeds, tools, a truck transporting raw material to a factory. |
| **Single Use Goods** | Finished in **one use** (consumed immediately and once for all). | Bread, butter (consumer goods); coal, raw material (producer goods). |
| **Durable Use Goods** | Can be used **again and again** for a long period of time. | Furniture, television (consumer goods); machines, tractors (producer goods). |
| **Private Goods** | Exclusively owned and enjoyed by **individuals** (private ownership). | Your watch, pen, scooter. |
| **Public Goods** | Owned and enjoyed by the **society as a whole** (collectively owned); available to all without discrimination. | Roads, bridges, parks. |

### 4. Basic Economic Activities

The essential economic activities of an economy are production, consumption, and capital formation. These are all inter-related.

1.  **Production:** Defined as the **creation of utility**. It involves combining factors of production (inputs) along with raw materials to create goods and services (output).
    *   **Factors of Production (Inputs):** Land, Labour, Capital, and Entrepreneurship.
    *   **Factor Incomes/Payments:** Owners of these factors receive payment for their services: **Rent** (for land), **Wages** (for labour), **Interest** (for capital), and **Profit** (for entrepreneurship).
2.  **Consumption:** The activity of using goods and services for the **direct satisfaction** of individual or collective human wants.
3.  **Capital Formation (Investment):** This occurs when part of current production is **saved** (not consumed) and invested to increase the existing stock of capital goods (like plant or machinery). This expands the production potential for the future.

***

## Module 3: Central Problems of an Economy and Economic Systems

### 5. Scarcity and Choice

The fundamental economic problem facing every economy is the need to make a **choice**. This problem arises because:

1.  **Resources are Scarce (Limited):** Wants are multiple, but resources (like money, land, or labour) are limited.
2.  **Resources have Alternative Uses:** The scarce resources can be put into many different uses (e.g., money can buy a book or a gift, but not both).

### 6. The Central Problems of an Economy

Every economy must solve three fundamental allocation problems:

1.  **What goods and services shall be produced and in what quantities?** (The choice between producing, for example, more food crops or more computers).
2.  **How shall goods and services be produced?** (The choice of production method).
    *   **Labour Intensive Technology:** Uses more labour and less capital per unit of output (common in small-scale or household production).
    *   **Capital Intensive Technology:** Uses more capital (machinery) and less labour per unit of output (common in large-scale production for profit, such as corporations).
3.  **For Whom goods and services are to be produced?** (The problem of distribution of income and wealth in societyâ€”whose wants are satisfied, the rich or the poor?).

In addition to allocation, economies face the problems of:
*   **Utilization of Resources (Efficiency):** Ensuring scarce resources are **fully employed** and not left unutilized or under-utilised (which constitutes wastage).
*   **Growth of Resources:** Ensuring resources like labour, capital, and technology grow over time to meet increasing needs and improve the standard of living.

### 7. Types of Economic Systems

Economies are generally categorized based on the ownership and control over the means of production or resources.

| Economy Type | Resource Ownership / Control | Guiding Principle / Objective | Resource Allocation Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Capitalist Economy (Free Enterprise)** | Private ownership (land, machines, factories). | **Profit Motive** and self-interest. | Prices and markets (price mechanism) guide decisions based on demand and supply, ensuring maximum output at minimum cost. **Consumer Sovereignty** (consumers are king) is vital. |
| **Socialist Economy (Centrally Planned)** | Collective ownership (controlled by the government). | **Social Welfare Objective**. | Decisions are made by a **Central Planning Authority** (government) which sets targets and allocates resources based on national priorities and people's basic needs (e.g., health, education). |
| **Mixed Economy** | **Co-existence** of public sector (government owned) and private sector (privately owned). | Private sector aims for profit; Public sector aims for social welfare. | Government planning sets targets for the public sector, while market mechanisms (prices) guide the private sector, subject to government regulation (licensing, taxes). Aims to combine production efficiency with distribution justice. |

## Module 4: Distribution of Goods and Services

### 1. Supply: The Seller's Perspective

Just as "demand" represents the buyer's side, "supply" represents the seller's side of the market.

#### Meaning of Supply

**Supply of a commodity is the quantity of the commodity that a seller offers for sale at a given price at a given time**.

The definition of supply includes three essential elements:

1.  The quantity of a commodity offered for sale by a seller.
2.  The price of the commodity in the market at which the seller is willing to sell that quantity.
3.  The time period during which the seller is willing to sell that quantity (which may vary, such as a month, a week, or two weeks).

#### Stock vs. Supply

It is important not to confuse stock and supply.

*   **Stock:** The total quantity of a commodity available with a seller or firm at a particular **point of time**.
*   **Supply:** That part of the stock that the seller is ready to sell at a given price during a given **period of time**.
*   **Relationship:** Supply is always a **part of the stock** of the commodity.

#### Factors Affecting Individual Supply

Individual supply is the supply of a commodity by a single firm. The quantity an individual firm is willing to supply is influenced by several factors:

1.  **Price of the commodity:** A higher price results in a higher average revenue and total revenue. Since the producer wants to recover costs (cost of production) and earn profit, **price is a very important determinant**.
2.  **Technology of production:** Improvement in technology reduces the cost of production per unit, increasing the margin of profit. This induces the firm to supply **more**. Inferior technology increases cost and reduces supply.
3.  **Price of inputs:** If the price of inputs (like raw materials or milk for ice cream) falls, the cost of production falls, increasing the profit margin, and supply will **increase**. If input prices rise, supply decreases.
4.  **Price of other related goods:** If a farmer produces wheat and rice, and the price of rice increases, it becomes more profitable to produce rice. The farmer will divert resources from wheat production to rice production, increasing the supply of rice and **decreasing** the supply of wheat.
5.  **Objective of the firm:** Firms aiming to maximize **profits** supply more at a higher price. Firms aiming to maximize **sales** may supply more even at a lower price.
6.  **Government policy:** An increase in tax (like VAT or sales tax) increases the cost of production per unit, which decreases supply. A reduction in tax decreases cost and **increases supply**.

#### The Law of Supply

The Law of Supply describes the relationship between price and quantity supplied, assuming all other determinants (like technology, input prices, government policy, etc.) remain constant.

*   **Statement:** **All other factors determining supply remaining constant, the price of a commodity and its quantity supplied are directly related**.
*   **Meaning:** A firm supplies **more** quantity of a commodity at a **higher price** and **less** of it at a **lower price**.

#### The Supply Curve

The supply curve is the diagrammatic representation of the Law of Supply.

*   **Shape:** Due to the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, the supply curve is **upward sloping** (it moves up towards the right).
*   **Reasons for Upward Slope:**
    1.  A rise in price causes a rise in **profits**, inducing firms to supply more.
    2.  A rise in price induces the seller to dispose of at least a part of his stock.
    3.  Higher profits attract new firms to **enter the market**, adding to the total supply.

#### Market Supply

**Market supply** is the total quantity of a commodity supplied by **all the firms** in the market at a given price at a given time. It is found by simply adding up the individual supplies of all firms at that price.

*   **Determinants of Market Supply:** Market supply is affected by all factors influencing individual supply, plus two additional factors:
    1.  **Number of sellers/firms:** If the number of firms increases, market supply increases.
    2.  **Expected future price:** If the price is expected to rise in the future, firms will supply **less now** (holding back stock) to sell at a higher profit later. If the price is expected to fall, firms will sell **more now** to avoid future profit loss.

### 2. Determination of Price and Quantity

The price of a commodity in the market is determined by the interaction of the forces of **demand and supply**.

#### Meaning of Price

The **price** of a good or service is the amount of money a buyer pays for one unit of that good or service. The market price is the price at which it is sold in the market.

#### Factors Influencing a Seller's Price Fixation

A seller, whose main aim is to earn **profit** (Total Revenue minus Total Cost), considers several factors when fixing a price:

1.  **Cost of production:** The price fixed must be more than the per unit cost of production to ensure a profit margin.
2.  **Price fixed by other sellers:** If a seller fixes a price much higher than competitors for a similar commodity, they may lose sales and must decrease the price to remain comparable.
3.  **Expected sales at different prices:** The price fixed must ensure that the total quantity sold yields the maximum total profit.

#### Equilibrium Price

If a seller sets the price too high, quantity supplied may exceed quantity demanded (excess supply). If the price is too low, quantity demanded may exceed quantity supplied (excess demand).

*   **Definition:** **Equilibrium price** is the price at which the **quantity demanded of a commodity is equal to its quantity supplied**.
*   **Equilibrium Quantity:** The quantity demanded and supplied at the equilibrium price is called the **equilibrium quantity**.

#### Adjustments to Equilibrium (Disequilibrium)

When the market price is not the equilibrium price, there is a tendency for the price to shift until balance is reached.

1.  **Excess Supply (Price too high):** When quantity supplied is more than quantity demanded.
    *   *Adjustment:* Sellers have unsold stock, leading to competition among sellers. The price starts **falling** until it reaches the equilibrium price, where supply equals demand.

2.  **Excess Demand (Price too low):** When quantity demanded is more than quantity supplied.
    *   *Adjustment:* Buyers are unable to purchase the quantity they desire (shortage). This competition among buyers causes the price to start **rising** until it reaches the equilibrium price.

#### Effects of Changes in Demand and Supply on Equilibrium

Assuming the other force remains constant:

*   **Increase in Demand:** Leads to an **increase** in equilibrium price and an **increase** in equilibrium quantity.
*   **Decrease in Demand:** Leads to a **decrease** in equilibrium price and a **decrease** in equilibrium quantity.
*   **Increase in Supply:** Leads to a **decrease** in equilibrium price and an **increase** in equilibrium quantity.
*   **Decrease in Supply:** Leads to an **increase** in equilibrium price and a **decrease** in equilibrium quantity.

### 3. Market and Market Structures

#### Meaning of Market

In economics, a market is not limited to a physical place. **Market refers to the arrangement in a given area whereby buyers and sellers come in contact with each other directly or indirectly, to buy or sell goods**.

*   **Mechanism:** A market is a mechanism or system by which buyers and sellers interact to determine the price and quantity of a good or service.
*   **Key Features:** A market requires a commodity being traded, buyers and sellers, and communication between them. Transactions can occur through agents, telephone, mobile, or the internet.

#### Structure of Market (Ideal Types)

Market structure is defined by the nature of the product, and the number of sellers and buyers. The two extreme theoretical forms are Monopoly and Perfect Competition.

| Feature | Monopoly | Perfect Competition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number of Sellers** | A single firm/seller (the monopolist). | Large number of sellers and buyers. |
| **Product** | Unique product with **no close substitute**. | **Homogeneous product** (single type of product sold). |
| **Control over Price** | **Price Maker** (decides the price). | Price Taker (determined by market forces). |
| **Entry/Exit** | No entry of new firms possible. | **Free entry and exit** of firms. |
| **Goal** | Maximize profit. | Maximize profit. |
| **Real World Situation** | Private monopoly is generally not allowed; government monopoly exists (e.g., atomic energy, railways in India). | Does not exist in the real world. |

*Note: In reality, most markets are characterized by Monopolistic or Imperfect Competition, where many sellers sell variations (different brands, colors, packaging) of a product (e.g., soap) and use advertisements, contrary to perfect competition.*

#### Classification of Markets by Distribution Channel

Markets can also be classified based on the saleable lots:

1.  **Wholesale markets:** Goods are transacted in **big lots**. Wholesalers sell mainly to retailers and institutions. They link manufacturers and end consumers, allowing manufacturers to sell large quantities.
2.  **Retail markets:** Goods are sold in **small lots** for direct consumption by the purchaser. Retailers are in direct contact with the final consumers, making the location and presentation of goods very important.

#### Online Market (Online Shopping)

This is an innovative process where consumers directly buy goods or services from a seller over the internet without an intermediary service (also known as electronic commerce).

*   **Features:** Available 24 hours a day; allows consumers to purchase from home/work; requires detailed product descriptions (text, photos, multimedia).
*   **Payment Methods:** Credit/debit cards, cash on delivery, billing to mobile phones, cheques, postal money orders.

### 4. Role of Government in Price Determination

While market forces (demand and supply) usually determine the equilibrium price, the government sometimes intervenes to protect consumers or producers.

**Administered Price:** A price determined by the government, fixed either below or above the equilibrium price.

1.  **Control Price (Ceiling Price):**
    *   **Level:** Maximum price fixed by the government, generally **lower than the equilibrium price**.
    *   **Purpose:** To protect the interests of **poor consumers** who cannot afford the commodity at the high equilibrium price.
    *   **Problem:** Creates **excess demand** (shortage).
    *   **Consequences:** Government may resort to **rationing** (fixing a quota per person) and the risk of **black marketing** (seller illegally charges much higher than the control price).

2.  **Support Price (Floor Price):**
    *   **Level:** Minimum price fixed by the government, generally **higher than the equilibrium price**.
    *   **Purpose:** To protect the interests of **producers (especially farmers)** who might not even cover their cost of production at a low equilibrium price.
    *   **Problem:** Creates **excess supply** of the commodity.
    *   **Consequences:** The government is often ready to purchase any quantity of the commodity at this price to make a **buffer stock**.

3.  **Token Price:**
    *   **Level:** A price much **below the per unit cost of production**.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide necessary goods and services (like medical, health, or education) to the poor who cannot afford market prices. It is charged to prevent the **wasteful use** of these services.

4.  **Dual Price Policy:**
    *   **Mechanism:** A part of the production is sold at the **control price through fair price shops**, and the remaining part is sold at the prevailing market price determined by demand and supply.
    *   **Purpose:** To avoid the shortage and black marketing problems caused by simple price control.

#### Effect of Taxes and Subsidies on Price

*   **Taxes (Excise duty, Sales tax, Import duty):** These duties are recovered from buyers, increasing the cost of the commodity. Therefore, an **increase in tax increases the market price**.
*   **Subsidies:** Given to producers to sell goods at a lower price. Therefore, an **increase in subsidy decreases the market price** of the commodity.

#### Public Distribution System (PDS)

PDS is a method used in India to help poor people by making essential commodities (like wheat, rice, sugar) available at cheaper rates through **fair price shops** (ration shops).

*   **Elements:**
    1.  **Subsidy:** Lowers the prices of commodities sold through PDS.
    2.  **Fixed Quantity (Rationing):** Government fixes a quota per household based on minimum requirement.
    3.  **Fair Price Shops (FPS):** These shops distribute the subsidized commodities using an identification paper called a ration card.

## Module 5: Money, Banking, and Saving

### 1. Money and Its Role

#### Barter System (The Precursor to Money)

In ancient times, before money, people exchanged one kind of goods and services for another kind of goods and services. This was called the **barter system**.

*   **Demerits (Why it failed):**
    1.  **Lack of double coincidence of wants:** Barter only works if the person wanting cloth (and offering rice) finds another person who has cloth and also wants rice in return. Such a mutual match is difficult.
    2.  **Lack of division of goods:** Certain goods are not physically divisible (e.g., a cow cannot be easily divided to trade for cloth and food grains).
    3.  **Lack of common unit of measurement:** Due to lack of divisibility, it was difficult to equate the values of different goods (e.g., how much cow equals how much food grains?).
    4.  **Storage problems:** A person must store a large volume of their own good to trade, requiring a difficult-to-maintain warehouse. Goods also lose quality/value when stored long-term.
    5.  **Not accepted for future trading (Store of Value):** Many goods are perishable (like salt, vegetables) and cannot be used for lending and borrowing purposes.

*   **Need for Money:** Money arose due to the failure of the barter system, as society needed a medium of exchange that could be easily carried, stored, and used to express value.

#### Definition and Functions of Money

**Money is defined as something which is generally accepted by the society as a medium of exchange and which can act as unit of account, can store value and be used for repayment of debt**.

*   **Functions:**
    1.  **Medium of Exchange (Primary Function):** People use money to buy or sell goods and services.
    2.  **Measure of Value (Unit of Account):** Money acts as a common measure of value, determining the value of a good by multiplying its price (expressed in monetary units) with the quantity sold.
    3.  **Store of Value:** Money holds purchasing power. A seller receives money (storing value) which can be used later, unlike perishable goods.
    4.  **Standard of Deferred Payment:** Payments in the future (like repaying a loan plus interest) are accepted in money only, as it retains its value.

#### Types of Money (Currency)

Modern money primarily takes the form of **paper currency notes and coins**.

*   **Issuance in India:** Currency notes and coins in circulation are guaranteed by the Government of India. The paper currency of various denominations (Rs. 2, 5, 10, etc.) is issued by the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**. One rupee notes and all coins are issued by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
*   **International:** Every country has its own currency (e.g., Dollar in USA, Euro in Europe).

### 2. Banking and Credit

#### Bank and Banking

A **bank is an institution which accepts money from public as deposits and gives loans to them**.

*   **Banking** refers to accepting deposits from the public for the purpose of lending or investment, which are payable on demand or withdrawable by cheque.

#### Functions of a Bank

1.  **Accepting Deposits from Public:** Banks accept deposits (from individuals, firms, etc.) and open accounts for depositors, sometimes giving interest on certain deposits. They issue cheque books to withdraw money or make payments.
2.  **Giving Loans:** Banks give loans to people who need money today (for consumption, expensive items, or starting a business) but have the capability to repay in the future.
3.  **Keeping Valuable Materials:** Banks provide **locker facilities** for the safe custody of valuables like jewelry and property documents.

#### Credit and Credit Creation

**Credit** is defined as the claim to receive payments. When a bank gives a loan, it can claim the money from the borrower in the future.

*   **Process of Credit Creation:** Banks do not keep all deposits in cash; they observe that people rarely withdraw all their money at once.
    1.  They keep a fraction of total deposits in cash (the **cash reserve ratio** or CRR), decided by the banking authority.
    2.  The remaining amount is used to give loans.
    3.  When a bank gives a loan (e.g., Rs. 80), it creates a deposit claim (Rs. 80) and thus expands its overall deposits.
*   **Formula:** Total Credit = Initial Increase in Deposit $\times$ (1 / Cash Reserve Ratio).
*   **Credit Capacity:** The capacity of a bank to create credit is **inversely related** to the CRR. If the CRR is higher (e.g., 20%), less money is available for loans, leading to less credit creation. If CRR is lower (e.g., 10%), credit creation is higher.

#### Types of Banks in India

1.  **Reserve Bank of India (RBI):** The **Central Bank** and head of the banking system in India. It issues currency notes and acts as a **banker to the government** (central and state).
2.  **Commercial Banks:** These are the primary banks that accept deposits and give loans (like SBI, PNB in the public sector; ICICI, HDFC in the private sector). Their aim is to earn profit.
3.  **Cooperative Banks:** Run by cooperative societies, providing credit for farming/livestock in rural areas and self-employment/small-scale industry in urban areas.
4.  **Development Banks:** Provide long-term credit for investment in industries and infrastructure creation (e.g., Industrial Development Bank of India).

### 3. Saving and Insurance

#### Saving

**Saving is the amount of income which is carried forward to future after meeting the current expenditure on goods and services and other things**.

*   **Formula:** Saving = Income â€“ Consumption.
*   **Usefulness of Saving:**
    1.  It increases the person's future income (by providing a starting balance).
    2.  It acts as a **security** for the future (e.g., sustaining oneself during illness).
    3.  Collective savings in banks/post offices are used for **development of the economy** (building roads, hospitals, schools).

*   **Where to Keep Savings:** Savings should be kept in secured institutions like **Post Office Savings Banks** or **Commercial Banks**, as keeping money idle or in a saving box (informal way) is unsafe and does not earn a return.

#### Interest

**Interest** is the return earned on saving. It is the money charged by a lender from a borrower for the use of the saving (loan amount).

*   **Rate of interest:** Defined as the earning by the lender (or payment by the borrower) for the use of every 100 Rupees for a period of one year.

#### Insurance (Managing Risk)

Since the future is uncertain (e.g., illness, accidents, drought, fire), uncertainty involves the **risk of loss or damage**. **Insurance ensures some compensation against loss/damage**.

*   **Definition:** **Insurance can be defined as a financial product which can be purchased to partly or fully recover any loss happening due to event beyond the control of the insured party**.
*   **Insurer and Insured:** The seller of insurance (usually an insurance company) is the **insurer**, and the buyer is the **insured**.
*   **Premium:** The money paid by the insured to purchase the insurance.
*   **Claim:** The amount paid by the insurance company to the insured to compensate for the loss.

*   **Types of Insurance Products:**
    1.  **Auto Insurance:** Covers damages to durable goods like scooters, bikes, or cars. Premium decreases as the vehicle gets older and its value falls.
    2.  **Health Insurance:** Allows the insured person to get back some money spent on medical treatment. Premium is typically lower for younger people.
    3.  **Life Insurance:** Purchased for a specific period (e.g., 10-25 years). The company pays the claim amount to the person when the term is over, or to a nominee if the person dies in between.

## Module 6: Data in Economics

### Collection and Presentation of Data

This lesson introduces foundational concepts related to quantitative information used in economics.

### I. Meaning and Features of Data
Data refers to **quantitative information** that provides facts in an aggregate manner. It is also known as statistical data or simply statistics.

Key features defining data/statistics include:
1. **Aggregate of Facts:** A single fact is not considered statistics; data must be an aggregate of facts to be meaningful and allow for analysis.
2. **Numerically Expressed:** Data is always quantitative. Qualitative information, such as "good," "bad," or "handsome," are merely attributes and cannot be quantified as statistics.
3. **Affected by Multiplicity of Causes:** Data is influenced by many factors, not just a single one (e.g., price rises are due to reduced supply, increased demand, higher taxes, rising wages, etc.).
4. **Reasonable Standard of Accuracy:** Perfect accuracy (100%) is neither achievable nor required; a reasonable standard is expected.
5. **Predetermined Purpose:** Data are collected with a specific, predetermined goal in mind.

### II. Importance of Data in Economics
Data is critically important in several economic areas:
*   **Economic Planning:** Data from previous years is used to forecast and prepare future plans (e.g., predicting per capita income growth requires data on national income and population growth).
*   **National Income Determination:** Quantitative information (such as wages, rent, interest, and profits) is required to calculate the national income.
*   **Basis of Government Policies:** Statistical data is used to frame policies for economic development (e.g., data on poverty/unemployment informs schemes like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act).

### III. Types and Sources of Data
Data is classified based on its source of collection:
*   **Primary Data:** This data is originally collected for the first time for a specific survey purpose (e.g., an investigator collecting facts on coffee-drinking habits in a village).
*   **Secondary Data:** This data has already been collected by others. It is considered "primary" for the agency that collected it first, and "secondary" for all subsequent users.

**Methods of Collecting Primary Data**:
1.  **Direct Personal Investigation:** The investigator personally collects data from the respondent (highly reliable, but prone to personal bias).
2.  **Indirect Investigations:** Information is obtained from a knowledgeable third person.
3.  **Through Correspondents:** Agents are appointed to collect and transmit information (often used by newspaper offices).
4.  **By Mailed Questionnaire:** A structured questionnaire is posted to respondents (only feasible if respondents are literate).
5.  **Through Schedules:** Field workers visit respondents with questions and record answers themselves (useful when respondents are illiterate).

### IV. Presentation of Data
Raw data collected through surveys are not self-explanatory; they require classification and tabulation to be systematically presented and made meaningful.

#### A. Classification (Variables and Attributes)
*   **Variable:** When data can be classified by magnitude (time or size), such as height or length.
    *   *Discrete Variable:* Has a specific, separate value (e.g., number of children per family, which cannot be broken into factors).
    *   *Continuous Variable:* Has continuity in its scale and measurement (e.g., height, weight).
*   **Attribute:** When data cannot be classified by magnitude (e.g., beauty, intelligence, bravery).

#### B. Statistical Series
Data can be organised into three types of series:
1.  **Individual Series:** Items are shown individually with their corresponding value (e.g., marks of students). When raw data is arranged in ascending or descending order, it is called an **array**.
2.  **Discrete Series:** Shows specific variables with definite breaks and their **frequencies** (the number of times a value repeats).
3.  **Continuous Series:** Groups variables are classified into corresponding groups (e.g., height ranges $60^{\prime \prime}-62^{\prime \prime}$).

#### C. Tabulation and Diagrams
*   **Tabulation:** Data is arranged into rows and columns in a statistical table, which can be simple or complex.
*   **Diagrammatic and Graphic Presentation:** This is a geometrical way to present facts, making complex data easier to understand quickly. Simple bar diagrams are a common one-dimensional type, where only the height is relevant.

### Analysis of Data

This lesson focuses on summarizing and analyzing the quantitative data collected and presented in Lesson 17.

### I. Meaning of Central Tendency
Analysis of data is a technique used to extract significant facts from numerical information. A key goal of analysis is to find a single value that represents the characteristics of the entire dataset.

*   This representative value is called the **average** or **measure of central tendency**.
*   **Central tendency** is the observed tendency of data to cluster towards a central location or value.
*   The average (mean) is useful because it provides a single value that represents all items, facilitating quick comprehension.

### II. Purpose and Functions of Averages
Averages serve several important functions:
*   Converting collected information and raw data into a brief summary.
*   Facilitating comparison between two or more groups of data.
*   Presenting a representative value from raw data.
*   Facilitating future policy and programme development.
### Arithmetic Mean (Average)

Where,  
- **x** = item  
- **Î£x** = sum of the items  
- **N** = number of items  
- **xÌ„** = arithmetic mean  

Arithmetic mean, in common language, is popularly known as **average**.  
It is very easy to calculate.  

Say, for example, there are 10 students in a class.  
They scored marks in economics out of 10 as follows:

| Student | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mark** | 2 | 7 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 0 |

Here, â€˜xâ€™ is marks in economics.  
Let us start with the sum of the marks:  
2 + 7 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 0 = **50**

Clearly, 10 students secured **50 marks (Î£x)** in all.  
Number of students (N) is **10**,  
so the average of the marks scored by 10 students is:

\[
\bar{x} = \frac{Î£x}{N} = \frac{50}{10} = 5
\]

Hence, the **arithmetic mean = 5**.


### IV. Calculation of Arithmetic Mean in Different Series
The calculation method changes depending on how the data is organized:

1.  **Individual Series**:
    *   *Direct Method:* $X = \Sigma x / N$.

2.  **Discrete Series**:
    *   *Direct Method:* $X = \Sigma fx / N$ (where $N$ is the sum of frequencies).

3.  **Continuous Series**:
    *   In continuous series, the value $x$ used in the formula represents the **mid-value** of the class.

### V. Precautions for Using Arithmetic Mean
Two important precautions must be noted when using the arithmetic mean:
1.  It is a **theoretical value** and may not represent an actual, realistic fact (e.g., $2.7$ children per family).
2.  It **cannot be used for qualitative data** (attributes) such as beauty or honesty.

## Module 7: Indian Economy

### 1. Overview of Indian Economy

#### State at Independence (Legacy of British Rule)

The British exploited Indiaâ€™s resources for their gain, resulting in specific economic features at independence (1947):

1.  **Decline of Handicraft Industry:** Kings/Emperors supported local artisans, but the British defeat of local rulers and the introduction of cheaper, machine-made textiles from England destroyed the Indian handicraft industry.
2.  **Production of Cash Crops:** Farmers were encouraged (by money offers) to grow cash crops (e.g., raw cotton, jute, indigo) needed as raw materials for factories in England, which reduced the area available for food grain cultivation.
3.  **Famines and Food Shortage:** Famines occurred frequently (nearly 33 times) due to dependence on rainfall, British export of food grains (for revenue and soldiers fighting abroad), and reduced food crop area.
4.  **Rise of Intermediaries:** The British appointed intermediaries (Zamindars in the east, Mahalwaris in the west, Ryotwaris in the south) to collect land revenue. These intermediaries became exploiters, mercilessly collecting revenue regardless of poor harvests, growing rich at the expense of common people.

*   **Positive Contributions (Though self-serving):** Introduction of Railways (1850), establishment of the first jute mill, cotton mill, and coal mine (1850-1855), and setting up telecommunication, telegraph, and post offices.

#### Features After Independence

The Indian economy is marked by ongoing challenges despite development efforts:

1.  **Low Level of Per Capita Income:** Per capita income (National Income / Population) is a major indicator of living standard. In 2009-10, India's per capita income (Rs. 33,731/year) was very low, insufficient for leading a decent life.
2.  **Slow Growth of Per Capita Income:** Income must grow to satisfy increasing wants and offset rising prices (inflation). However, the increase in per capita income has been slow (e.g., only Rs. 160/month increase between 2008-09 and 2009-10).
3.  **Heavy Population Pressure:** India is overpopulated (1.21 billion in 2011), second only to China, requiring immense resources (food, clothes, education, roads). A positive aspect is the high number of young people (low dependency ratio).
4.  **Existence of Poverty:** Nearly one-third of the worldâ€™s poor live in India, with about 27.5% of the total population suffering from poverty in 2004-05. Poverty is defined by insufficient income to afford basic necessities (food, clothing, shelter, healthcare).
5.  **Dependence on Agriculture:** Indian economy is traditionally agriculture-based. While dependence has reduced, around **60% of the population was still dependent on agriculture** in 2001.
6.  **Planning for Development:** India adopted a strategy of **Five Year Plans** starting in 1951 to achieve systematic development. Planning involves making preparations to solve problems, setting targets, allocating resources (e.g., money for agriculture, industry, education), and periodically evaluating progress.

### 2. Sectoral Aspects of Indian Economy

The population pursues occupations classified into three sectors:

1.  **Primary Sector:** Activities revolving around natural resources.
    *   *Activities:* Agriculture and allied activities (cultivation, livestock), Fishery, Forestry, and Mining and Quarrying.
    *   *Role:* Mainstay of the economy, providing food to millions, raw materials to industries (e.g., sugar, cotton textiles), and employment to the largest section of the population (about 50% in 2009-10). Its share in national income (15% in 2009-10) has reduced since independence.

2.  **Secondary Sector:** Activities transforming raw materials into goods.
    *   *Activities:* Manufacturing (small and large scale), Construction, and Gas, water, and electricity supply.
    *   *Role:* Contributes to national income (28% in 2009-10), employment generation (providing 3.3 crore jobs), provision of consumer goods (clothes, cars, pens), and **creation of infrastructure** (roads, dams, power).

3.  **Tertiary Sector (Service Sector):** Activities providing services rather than physical goods.
    *   *Activities:* Trade, Hotels, Restaurants, Transport, Communication, Financial services (Banking, Insurance), Real Estate, Public Administration, and others.
    *   *Role:* **Largest contributor to National Income** (55.2% in 2009-10). Employs a growing number of people (29.4% in 2009-10). Attracts large foreign investment and contributes significantly to **exports** (earning foreign exchange, e.g., through IT and consultancy services).

*   **Linkages Among Sectors:** All three sectors are **interlinked**, complementing and supplementing each other. For example, agriculture (primary) needs diesel pumps (secondary/industry) and transport/banking (tertiary/service), while industry and services need food supplied by agriculture.

### 3. Challenges of Indian Economy

India faces critical challenges in poverty, health, education, price control, and growth.

#### Tackling Poverty and Unemployment

*   **Poverty Line (Definition):** Anyone unable to get **2400 kilo calories (kcl)** from food intake in rural areas or **2100 kcl** in urban areas is considered poor. In 2004-05, poverty stood at 27.5% based on food intake, or over 37% including non-food necessities.
*   **Employment Programs (Poverty Alleviation):**
    1.  **MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme):** Aims to provide **100 days of guaranteed wage employment** in unskilled manual work to rural households.
    2.  **SGSY (Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana):** Helps rural poor achieve self-employment (Swarozgaris) by providing training, bank loans, and facilities.
    3.  **SJSRY (Swarna Jayanti Sahari Rozgar Yojna):** Provides employment (self-employment and wage employment) and training for poor families in **urban areas**.

#### Providing Education

The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04% for all adults. Measures include:

*   **Right to Education Act 2009:** Mandates **free and compulsory education for all children between 6 to 14 years of age** as a fundamental right (effective April 2010).
*   **Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA):** A scheme (Central/State partnership) focused on universal enrolment, retention, and closing the gap due to caste/gender in elementary education (age 6-14).
*   **Mid-day Meal Program:** Provides healthy diets to attract and retain children in schools, fostering a sense of belongingness.
*   **Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA):** Launched in 2009 to increase enrolment in the secondary stage.
*   **Saakshar Bharat:** Promotes education and literacy among **adults above 15 years**, with a special focus on women.
*   **Higher Education:** Establishing new universities, engineering colleges (NITs, IITs), and management institutes (IIMs) to establish a knowledge society.

#### Providing Health Care

India faces high Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), and Child Mortality Rate (CMR). Health spending is low (1.27% of national income).

*   **National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) (2005):** Aims to provide affordable, qualitative health services to the rural population. Focuses on strengthening health programs and removing diseases (like malaria, TB). Runs Mobile Medical Units (MMUs).
*   **Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY):** A scheme to save the life of the mother during delivery.
*   **Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY):** Aims to remove regional imbalances in healthcare by constructing six new AIIMS-like institutions and upgrading 12 existing medical colleges.
*   **National AIDS Control:** Focuses on generating awareness and treating people affected by the HIV virus.

#### Controlling Price Rise (Inflation)

Price rise (inflation) hits poor and middle-class buyers badly, as their income buys less.

*   **Causes of Price Rise:** Shortage, which occurs if production is inadequate (e.g., due to drought), lack of proper storage facilities (wastage), or **hoarding** (sellers deliberately storing goods to create artificial shortage and charge more).
*   **Government Measures:** Helping farmers (subsidies on seeds/fertilizer), building storehouses and cold storages to ensure availability, and keeping strict vigil on hoarding.

#### Achieving Higher Economic Growth

Economic growth means an increase in the country's total income and per capita income, achieved by increasing agricultural and industrial production and expanding the service sector.

*   **Strategy:** Encouraging industries (small, large, heavy), promoting better inputs (seeds, fertilizer) for agriculture, and improving infrastructure (roads, power) to boost the service sector. These steps, including modifications to rules, are known as **economic reforms**.

### 4. Indian Economy in the Global Context

#### Globalization

**Globalization** refers to the process where different countries of the world come closer to each other through trade, transport, and communication systems. Technological advances (internet, mobile phones) have facilitated this process, allowing people to exchange goods, services, and ideas easily.

#### Comparison (India, USA, China)

*   **USA (Developed Economy):** Characterized by a major role for the **private sector** and minimal government interference. High level of development in agriculture (a major exporter) and manufacturing. A top exporter and the biggest importer globally. Its currency (US dollar) is an international currency. Suffers from poverty and unemployment (e.g., 9.9% unemployment in 2010).
*   **China (Fast-Developing Economy):** Became the world's second largest economy after pursuing **economic reforms** (post-1980s). Governed by one party (not a democracy). Adopted a **five-year plan strategy** (like India). Has achieved rapid growth in national and per capita income, far exceeding India's growth rate in recent decades. Its poverty ratio fell significantly faster than Indiaâ€™s (2.5% in 2005 vs. 27.5% in India).

## Module 8: Contemporary Economic Issues

### 1. Environment and Sustainable Development

#### Environment and Its Significance

*   **Definition:** The environment encompasses all living (biotic, e.g., plants, animals) and non-living (abiotic, e.g., air, water, rocks) things that influence each other on Earth.
*   **Significance:**
    1.  **Provides resources:** Both **renewable resources** (replenished easily, e.g., trees, fish) and **non-renewable resources** (depleted over time, e.g., fossil fuels, minerals).
    2.  **Absorbs wastes:** Assimilates wastes (smoke, sewage, industrial effluents), cleaning and recycling them through natural processes.
    3.  **Sustains life:** Provides biodiversity, allowing life forms to adapt and evolve.
    4.  **Aesthetic value:** Provides scenery and landscapes.

#### Environmental Problems (Pollution and Degradation)

Economic production uses resources and causes pollution, degradation, and depletion.

*   **Pollution:** An undesirable change in the quality of a natural resource or ecosystem, caused by a **pollutant** (waste material).
    *   **Air Pollution:** Introduction of harmful materials (smoke from factories, vehicle exhaust, toxic metals) into the atmosphere, causing respiratory and cardiac problems.
    *   **Water Pollution:** Contamination of water bodies (lakes, rivers) by untreated pollutants (sewage, industrial effluents, farm chemicals), causing waterborne diseases (cholera, typhoid) and killing aquatic life.
    *   **Noise Pollution:** Excessive noise (traffic, industrial processes, construction), causing hypertension, high stress, hearing loss, and sleep disturbances.

*   **Degradation:**
    *   **Soil Degradation:** An undesirable change in soil quality, reducing its productivity by losing nutrients (humus). Caused by excessive use of chemical fertilizers/pesticides, waterlogging (excessive irrigation), and overgrazing. Leads to desertification.
    *   **Habitat Degradation:** Loss of a habitat's normal quality to support native life due to human activities (e.g., deforestation, conversion to agriculture, urbanization). This reduces the carrying capacity, causing loss of biodiversity and species extinction.

*   **Depletion of Resources:** Exhaustion of raw materials in an area (common in farming, fishing, and mining). Rapid over-exploitation of non-renewable resources (like oil, gas, minerals) threatens future generations.

#### Sustainable Development

**Sustainable development is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for generations to come**.

*   **Core Principle:** Development must take into account the needs of both the present economy and the environment, ensuring the present use of resources does not compromise the ability of **future generations** to meet their own needs.
*   **Achieving Sustainability (The Three 'R's and Substitutes):**
    1.  **Resources/Substitutes:** Finding substitutes for non-renewable resources (e.g., using solar, wind, and tidal energy instead of coal/oil).
    2.  **Recycling:** Re-processing used items (e.g., recycling paper to save trees; rainwater harvesting).
    3.  **Reduce (Economize):** Restraining consumption to basic needs and avoiding unnecessary use (e.g., walking instead of driving, switching off lights).

### 2. Consumer Awareness

#### Consumer Definitions

*   **Consumer:** The **buyer** of goods and services. A user of the goods with the buyer's permission is also a consumer. A person buying goods for **resale** is **not** a consumer.
*   **Goods:** Manufactured or produced products sold to consumers.
*   **Services:** Provision of facilities related to banking, insurance, transport, health, amusement, etc. (does not include free services or personal contract services).
*   **Consumer Awareness:** Combination of knowledge about product quality, hazards associated with marketing, **Consumer Rights**, and Consumer Responsibilities.

#### Need for Consumer Awareness

Consumers need protection due to:

1.  **Market Complexity:** Large number and variety of goods and sellers, making it hard to identify genuine products.
2.  **Misleading Information:** Producers hide crucial information (like expiry dates) or use deceptive advertisements.
3.  **No Bill/Tax Avoidance:** Sellers often do not provide a bill, allowing them to avoid paying tax (VAT). If a product is faulty, the consumer has no proof of purchase to file a complaint.
4.  **Consumer Weakness:** Producers/traders are organized (Associations), but buyers are weak and unorganized, leading to exploitation.
5.  **Environmental/Social Harm:** Mindless and wasteful consumption by rich consumers causes pollution and increases inequality.

#### Consumer Rights (The Six Rights)

1.  **Right to Information:** Consumers must receive enough information (price, quality, dates, ingredients) to make informed choices.
2.  **Right to Choose:** Consumers have the freedom to decide what to buy and must not be forced to buy unwanted products (e.g., forced package deals).
3.  **Right to Safety:** Protection against goods that are unsafe to health and life (e.g., adulterated food, faulty electronics).
4.  **Right to be Heard:** Consumers' interests must be considered in appropriate forums, empowering them to voice complaints.
5.  **Right to Seek Redressal:** The right to obtain compensation for damage caused by unfair/exploitative trade practices.
6.  **Right to Consumer Education:** Access to programs and information (like ISI, AGMARK marks, government guidelines) to help consumers make better decisions.

#### Consumer Responsibilities

1.  **Caution with Advertisements:** Consumers must be cautious of deceptive advertisements that hide crucial information.
2.  **Buying Quality Certified Products:** Choose products certified safe (e.g., marked with **ISI** or **AGMARK**) and always check the **expiry date**.
3.  **Demanding the Bill:** The bill is proof of purchase (needed for complaints) and ensures the government receives its tax revenue.
4.  **Being a Green Consumer:** Consume products that do not damage the environment (e.g., using biodegradable products, avoiding plastic bags, conserving electricity).
5.  **Consumers as Managers:** Consumers can unite (e.g., in village 'Pani Samitis') to manage essential service delivery (like water supply) locally.

#### Consumer Redressal System in India

The system is designed to provide **cheap, simple, and quick justice**.

*   **Legislation:** The most important law is the **Consumer Protection Act (CPA) 1986**. It applies to all goods and services and covers private, public, and cooperative sectors.
*   **Institutional Machinery (The Three-Tier System):**
    1.  **District Consumer Forum (DCF):** Hears complaints where the value is **up to Rs. 20 lakhs**.
    2.  **State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC):** Hears complaints where the value is **up to Rs. 1 crore**.
    3.  **National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC):** The apex body, hears complaints where the value is **above Rs. 1 crore**.

*   **Filing a Complaint:** Must be filed within **2 years** of the defect/cause of action. The consumer needs the cash memo/bill and must specify the fault and the remedy sought (refund/compensation).
*   **Challenges:** The consumer movement is hampered by the massive need to spread awareness in rural India and by the **untimely delivery of justice** (due to repeated adjournments and judge vacancies).

## Marginal

When something is described as "marginal," it refers to the **change** that results from a one-unit increase or decrease in a variable quantity.

Here is how the concept of "marginal" is applied across different economic elements discussed in the sources:

### 1. Marginal Product (MP)

In the context of production, the marginal product (MP) measures the change in output when one additional unit of a variable input (such as labour) is employed, while keeping all other inputs constant.

*   **Definition:** Marginal Product (MP) is the **increase or decrease in Total Product (TP)** resulting from the **addition of one extra unit of labour** (the variable factor), assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.
*   **Calculation:** MP is the output contributed by the last unit of labour. It can be calculated as the difference between the new total product and the previous total product:
    $$ \text{MP} = \text{TP}_L - \text{TP}_{L-1} $$
    (where $L$ is the current unit of labour).
*   **Behaviour (Law of Diminishing Marginal Product):** The marginal product of labour will initially increase, reach a peak, and then eventually decrease, potentially becoming zero or negative, when production continuously increases the variable factor while holding others constant. A producer should generally **stop employing labour before the marginal product becomes negative** (or specifically, when MP is zero, where TP is maximized).

### 2. Marginal Cost (MC)

In the context of costs, marginal cost measures the change in total cost resulting from producing one additional unit of output.

*   **Definition:** Marginal cost (MC) is the **increase in the total cost (TC)** due to the **increase in one extra unit of output**.
*   **Comparison to Average Cost:** Marginal cost is calculated between two successive levels of output, whereas average cost (AC) is calculated for every given level of output. 

### 3. Marginal Revenue (MR)

In the context of revenue, marginal revenue measures the change in total revenue resulting from selling one additional unit of output.

*   **Definition:** Marginal Revenue (MR) is defined as the **increase in total revenue (TR)** due to a **one-unit increase in the sale of the quantity of output**.
*   **Calculation:** MR is calculated for two successive levels of sale of the output.
*   **Relationship with Average Revenue (AR) and Price (P):** If a seller can sell successive quantities of output at the given or same price (P), then Average Revenue (AR) and MR will be equal (AR = MR). If the price changes for different quantities, then AR and MR will be different.
