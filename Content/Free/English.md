### Lesson 1: Snake Bite


**1.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
One day I saw a small snake in the compound. It was crawling along slowly but when it saw me, it moved away quickly and hid itself in a coconut shell. I quietly went near and closed the mouth of the coconut shell with a stone. Then I took the shell and ran to Grandmother. “ Look, Grandma,” I cried, “ I have caught a snake.” “ Snake?” asked Grandmother in alarm. She was shocked. She cried for help. Grandfather came running. When he learnt that I had a snake in the shell, he snatched the shell and threw it away. The snake crawled away and disappeared behind some bushes. Grandfather warned me never to go near a snake, because snakes were very dangerous. Later in the evening, I tried to catch a bee and it stung me on my finger. I felt a sharp pain. I ran to grandmother and told her that I had been bitten and wanted her to do something to stop the pain. Grandmother thought that I had been bitten by a snake. She called out to Grandfather, “Come and see what has happened to Raja.” Grandfather came at once. He looked at my finger and there was a blue mark. Without a word he took me in his arms and started running. He ran across the garden and through the paddy fields. He ran and ran and did not stop until he reached a small house quite some distance away from our home. Then he shouted for the man who lived there. An old grey haired man came out of the house. He knew the cure for snake bite. Grandfather asked him to cure me. The old man took me inside. He looked at my finger and then asked me to sit down and not to move. I sat on Grandfather’s lap. The old man then took some water in a small brass vessel, sat in front of us and started reciting some mantras. I wanted to tell him that it was a bee and not a snake that had bitten me. But Grandfather held me tight and did not allow me to talk. Grandmother too had arrived by then and some other people with her. They looked sad and silently watched me. By this time the pain in my finger had stopped. But still I had to sit there and get cured of ‘snake bite.’ After a few minutes, the old man got up, washed my finger and gave me some water to drink. He asked me to keep quiet for some more time. Then he turned to Grandfather and said, “Thank God, you brought Raja in time. He is out of danger now. It was indeed a poisonous snake that bit him.” Grandfather, Grandmother and all others thanked the old man for the magic cure. On returning home, Grandfather sent him gifts.

Ram asked his army to build a bridge over the sea. Work began at once on a stone bridge. The monkeys pulled out rocks and heavy stones from the mountains, and carried them to the sea. They cut them into shape and began to build the bridge. All this was very difficult work and it took a long time. Thousands of monkeys worked night and day. Rama felt happy. “How hard they work! Their love for me makes them work like this,” thought Rama. One day Rama saw a small brown squirrel. He was going up and down the seashore with little pebbles in his mouth. The little squirrel could carry only little pebbles at a time in his small mouth. He carried the pebbles from the seashore and dropped them into the sea. A great monkey was carrying a large heavy stone on his back and the squirrel came in his way. The monkey jumped back. “Here, you little thing,” shouted the monkey in a voice like thunder, “you’re in my way, I stepped back and you’re alive now. But I nearly fell. And what are you doing here?” The little squirrel looked up at the great monkey. “I’m sorry you nearly fell, Brother Monkey,” he said in his small voice, “but please always look where you are going. I’m helping Rama build the bridge. And I want to work hard for him.” “You, what?” shouted the monkey and laughed aloud. “Did you hear that!” he said to the other monkeys. “The squirrel is building a bridge with his pebbles. Oh dear! Oh dear! I’ve never heard a funnier story.” The other monkeys laughed too. The squirrel did not think this funny at all. He said, “Look, I can’t carry mountains or rocks. God gave me only a little strength. I can only carry pebbles. My heart cries out for Rama and I’ll do all I can for him.” The monkeys said, “Don’t be foolish. Do you think you can help Rama? Do you think we can build a bridge with pebbles? He has a big army to help him. Go home and don’t get in our way.” “But I want to help, too,” said the squirrel and would not go. He carried the pebbles again from the shore to the sea. The monkeys were angry and one of them picked up the squirrel by his tail and threw him far away. The squirrel, crying out the name of Rama, fell into his hands. Then Rama held the squirrel close to him. He said to the monkeys, “Do not make fun of the weak and the small. Your strength or what you do is not important. What matters is your love. This little squirrel has love in his heart.” He then held the squirrel closer to him and said, “Little one, your love touches my heart.” He said these words and passed his fingers gently over the little squirrel’s back. And when he put him down there were three white stripes on his back. These were the marks of Lord Rama’s fingers. From then on the squirrel carries the three white stripes on his back.

### Lesson 3: Kondiba—A Hero

**3.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
Kondiba Gaikwad hated begging. But the famine in Maharashtra in 1972-73 had driven him from his home in Aurangabad to Mumbai in search of bread. At first, he had tried selling brooms. Unfortunately, he had little luck selling his goods. He soon learnt that Mumbai is generous to beggars – especially blind beggars. And 25-year-old Kondiba was blind. He had become blind with small pox at the age of eight. It was a cloudy day in “Golibar”, the large slum colony in Ghatkopar, north-east of Mumbai. Kondiba lived here with Tukaram and Tukaram’s wife, Yelanbai. It was the end of the monsoon. In the middle of an open area, in the colony there was a well. It was full of blackish-green water. Nothing could be seen more than a few centimetres below the surface. The well was highly useful to the people who lived in the surrounding huts. They had dug it two years before because the only water tap in the colony was not enough for the slum’s growing population. There had never been any money for a wall around the well. The mouth of the well had gradually widened as the soil and rocks on the sides fell in. The bottom was narrow, muddy and filled with weeds. The well was dangerous; but it had been there for so long that no one worried about it. It seemed harmless. Kondiba had returned to the slum to eat a little food, which Yelanbai had prepared. His day’s begging usually ended when he had collected Rs. 5 to Rs. 6 in his small gunny bag. Suddenly, there were shouts and sounds of great confusion. Kondiba and Yelanbai were startled, “Someone’s fallen in the well!” they heard a woman cry. Kondiba set aside his meal and said urgently, “Quick, lead me there.” Within a minute the blind beggar and the woman reached the well, and pushed their way through a small group at the mouth of the well. In seconds Kondiba pulled off his shirt and slipped into the water. Two boys were already paddling around trying to find young Arvind, who had fallen off a tree trunk while drawing water. The boys could not dive. Kondiba had been a good swimmer as a young boy before he lost his sight. But years of poverty had made him weak. Once he had been able to dive deep into the wells around his village to pick up shining bits of broken pottery that he and his friends would throw in as part of a game. But it had been many years since he had tried to hold his breath long enough to get to the bottom of a well. Kondiba floated on the surface for a moment, then took a deep breath and dived. Carefully feeling his way along the rocks on the side of well, he reached the bottom; his feet sank into the soft mud. He felt nothing but the mud and the slippery weeds. Tired, and with his breath running out, he came to the surface. It was now two minutes since Arvind had fallen in. His aunt, with whom he lived, was at the well. As Kondiba surfaced without the boy he heard her wailing. The blind man took another deep breath and vanished into the muddy depths. His first dive had given him a good idea of the shape of the well. So he went straight down and tried to search the bottom with his hands. They slipped in the mud and got caught in the weeds. There was still no sign of the boy. His lungs were nearly bursting. He rose to the top once again. He had been down longer than the first time, so the women and children were getting more and more excited. When his head appeared above the water, the crowd gave a sigh of disappointment. Never in all the years of his blindness had Kondiba missed his vision so much. If only he could see, he might be able to find the drowning boy. He did not know that even normal eyes would never have been able to see in muddy water. Kondiba was very tired, but he knew he was Arvind’s only hope. He worked as fast as he could, feeling his way through the mud and the weeds. “Arvind must be here,” he thought. “He cannot have vanished.” Kondiba’s ribs were aching; he couldn’t hold his breath much longer. Then, just as he was about to twist his body upright and kick himself to the surface, his finger felt something soft among the weeds. Cloth! He moved his hand further and touched Arvind’s legs. The boy’s body was held in the mud and weeds. Kondiba’s heart was beating painfully, he badly needed to breathe. He felt desperately for something to hold in order to pull Arvind up and out of the net he was in. Suddenly, he felt Arvind’s belt! Holding it tightly with his right hand, he pulled the lad free, turned about and pushed up. His spine and muscles ached. This almost stopped his movements. His weak, starved body fought against what his mind told him he must do. Keeping a tight hold on the boy’s belt, Kondiba struggled to push himself upwards with his free hand and feet. It seemed a long time before he rose the six metres from the bottom and broke surface. While he gasped for breath, other hands quickly lifted Arvind up and out of the well. Kondiba held on to the well’s rocky side, his eyes closed, his body tired. He heard, but paid little attention to the sounds of people trying to give Arvind artificial respiration. Finally, the boy began to vomit water, and cries to joy came to Kondiba still holding tightly to the side of the well. Then Arvind was hurried away to the hospital. A man helped Kondiba out of the well and a woman patted him affectionately on the shoulder. Yelanbai led him back to the hut. There, Kondiba put on his clothes, finished his half-eaten meal, and fell asleep. That evening, a police officer came to tell the blind beggar that the boy he had saved would be alright. Kondiba later learnt that if the boy had been in the well longer his brain would certainly have been damaged from lack of oxygen. And Kondiba had saved him just in time. The next afternoon, Arvind returned to “Golibar”. He went at once to Kondiba and, while his aunt watched with tears in her eyes, he touched Kondiba’s feet in gratitude. Indeed, Kondiba had saved a life. But his own still had to go on, and for him that meant begging. By afternoon Kondiba was back on the streets of Mumbai with his gunnysack. However, word soon began to spread about the beggar’s courage. His picture and the story of his daring rescue were published in many national and local papers. Suddenly Kondiba became a hero. He was praised by the Governor, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, and other officials. Rewards totalling Rs. 12,970 were presented to him. For a few months, he was given a home in a Home for the Blind. Here he learnt some skills such as bottling and the weaving of chair seats. Today, Kondiba lives in Jalna, a market town close to his native village. He has married a local girl and runs a small business. Kondiba Gaikwad’s bravery and determination to find the boy in the well had completely changed his own life. The beggar who hated begging need never beg again.

**5.1 LET US READ THE TEXT (Part I)**
When I entered the Market Road, people ran for their lives at the sight of me. As I passed through, shutters were pulled down, and people hid themselves in drains, on trees, and behind pillars. The population was melting out of sight. At the circus I had no chance to study human beings. They had sat in their seats peacefully while I cowered before captain’s whip. I got a totally wrong idea of human beings at that angle. I had thought that they were strong and fearless. But now I found them running from me like a herd of deer, although I had no intention of attacking them. When I paused in front of a tailor’s shop, he abandoned his machine and shut himself in a cupboard, wailing, “Alas, I am undone, won’t someone shoot that tiger?” A prisoner, between two constables, got his chance to escape when the constables fled, abandoning him with his handcuffs. I tore a horse from its Jutka and enjoyed the sight of the passengers spilling out of it and running for their lives. Sheer hopelessness seemed to have seized the townspeople. They withdrew into their homes and even there remained nervous. All doors and windows everywhere were shut, bolted and sealed. Some even thought that I was some extraordinary creature who might pass through the walls and lie in wait on the roof or in the basement. Why should an ordinary, simple tiger have any interest in them, either to destroy or to safeguard? I rested for a moment at the door of a restaurant, the coffee drinkers and tiffin-eaters sat still at their tables, uttering low moans on seeing me. I wanted to assure them, ‘Don’t fear, I am not out to trouble you. Eat your tiffin in peace, don’t mind me….You – nearest to me, hugging the cash box – you are a coward, afraid – afraid even to breathe. Go on, count the cash, if that’s what you want. I just want to watch, that’s all….If my tail trails down to the street, if I am blocking your threshold, it is because I’m eleven feet tip to tail. I can’t help it, I’m not out to kill. I’m too full. I found a green pasture full of food on my way. I won’t need any food for several days to come. I won’t attack until I feel hungry again. Tigers attack only when they feel hungry, unlike human beings who kill one another without purpose or hunger’. To the great delight of children, schools were being hurriedly closed. Children of all ages and sizes were running helter-skelter, screaming joyously, ‘No school, no school. Tiger, Tiger!’ They were shouting and laughing and even enjoyed being scared. I followed them through their school gate while they ran up and shut themselves in the school hall. I climbed up the steps of the school, saw an open door at the far end of a verandah, and walked in. It happened to be the Headmaster’s room. I noticed a very dignified man jumping on his table and heaving himself up into an attic. I walked in and flung myself on the cool floor, having a special liking for cool stone floors, with my head under the large desk. I was in no mood to bother about anything. All I wanted was a little moment of sleep. While I slept, I had been properly locked up and was being watched. After I woke up, I heard a teacher saying, ‘Now that this brute is safely locked up, we must decide….’. At this moment my Master pushed his way through the crowds and scolded, ‘Never use the words ‘beast’ or ‘brute’. They’re ugly words coined by man in his arrogance. The human being thinks all other creatures are ‘beasts’. Awful word!’ ‘Is this the time to discuss problems of vocabulary?’ ‘Why not?’ retorted my Master, at which they looked extremely upset and angry. Someone said, ‘What a reckless man you are! Who are you?’ ‘You are asking a profound question. I’ve no idea who I am! All my life I have been trying to find the answer. Are you sure you know who you are?’

### Lesson 7: The Shoeshine

**7.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
I was standing outside the Tea House in Connaught Circus, idly watching the traffic. I wondered if I could afford a cup of coffee and a plate of potato chips, when a shoeshine walked up and put down his box in front of me. “Cream and polish sir?” he asked. “Your shoes do need a polish, sir”, the boy persisted. “Yes I know,” I said, smiling, “but I can’t afford it.” “Can’t afford it?” the shoeshine replied joining me with a smile. ‘Only four annas, sir.” “I haven’t got four annas for a shoe polish”, I said walking away. But there was a puzzled and hurt expression on his face, as if I was making fun of him, “You see, I am looking for a job.” The boy picked up his box and started walking with me. “Can’t get a job with dirty shoes like that, sir. The boss sahibs won’t like it.” “The boss sahibs don’t seem to like me in any case”, I answered beginning to get irritated. “Polished shoes won’t make things any better.” I wanted to get rid of the boy, but he persisted in walking with me. “You don’t live in Delhi”, he said after a while. “No”, I replied firmly. “I come from Calcutta and I don’t want my shoes polished.” “I have an uncle who works in Calcutta”, he went on. “Earns a lot of money in the house of a Bengali Babu.” Instantly the thought seized me. “And how much money do you earn?” I questioned. “Oh, it all depends. On a bad day about three rupees, on a good day when there are lots of tourists, about five. Sometimes more.” I did a spot of quick calculation in my mind. The answer sent a shiver through me. The shoeshine earned more than Ram Singh, a clerk in a Government office. Here at last was a solution. “Do you think I could…?” I asked hesitantly. “What sir?” “Polish shoes? Like you, I mean?” “Polish shoes? The boy asked stopping dead. “On the pavement, like me?” I didn’t expect the loud laugh that followed. It took me a lot of persuading. Shovan Lal, for that was his name, refused to believe that I wasn’t making fun of him. He had to leave school two years before his matriculation, why should I want to do his job when I had been to university? If he could speak English he certainly wouldn’t be polishing other people’s shoes. He would sit in an office and be a sahib himself, earning a regular monthly salary. But he hadn’t been born under a lucky star; his father had died of small pox about three years ago. No, shoe shinning was no job for an educated man like myself. What would my friends say? I explained that I had no friends in Delhi, that I had left home without sitting through my exams. And most important, that even if I did apply for a clerk’s job, I would be earning less than him. “But think of the status of working in an office with an electric fan over your head” Shovan Lal argued. ‘There is that, I suppose, I replied smiling, “but I have to get a job straightaway.” “Well” my friend said, reluctantly giving in, “if you really want to…. I mean I don’t know how the others will take it. There is a Shoeshines’ Union, you know. And Connaught Circus is a profitable place. If there’s an extra shoeshine, it means that everyone else earns a little bit less.” I hadn’t thought of it like that and Shovan Lal has opened up a whole new world for me. For the moment I lost the feeling of hopelessness and despair which had possessed me ever since I arrived in Delhi. To work as a shoeshine became the most important goal in my life. “But if I can persuade the others”, Shovan Lal said, breaking into my thoughts, “You will need to get all the stuff. A box like this one, brushes, cream and polish and some rags.” “Yes, of course,” I replied, drawn back to reality once again, “and how much will all that cost?” “About ten or twelve rupees, Shovan Lal answered should’nt be much more than that.” “Really”, I said and started laughing. “Why, what’s the matter? Don’t you believe me?” “Of course I believe you. But the simple fact is that I only have five rupees and some loose change.” This time Shovan Lal was really shocked. His mouth fell open and his eyes shot up in surprise. “You mean, you really mean…..?” “I’ m afraid I do,” I replied. “You see, I could never have an electric fan over my head.” He closed his eyes and his face became thoughtful while he put his hand inside the pockets of his half-pants several times. “Well,” he said, “we shall have to find a way.” It was nearly six o’clock and we walked a few yards in silence towards the Rivoli Cinema where a show had just ended. Shovan Lal quickened his steps. I must work now. But you come to see me at eleven o’clock after the last show. Then, I shall talk with my friends, and see what they say.” “All right”, I nodded, as I watched him walk away. “And don’t worry,” he shouted just before he turned the corner, “if they let you work there, we’ll find the money somehow,” I walked along the streets of Delhi. I wondered what the history of my country meant to me. Here was a land where man had achieved greatness on every plane-astronomy, algebra, architecture, even poetry, music and art. Yet in this very city, where seven empires had come and gone, where Akbar and Ashoka ruled, I could not get a job, and a boy like Shovan Lal had not been able to finish his schooling. By eleven o’clock I had walked eight miles. When I met Shovan Lal, Connaught Circus was nearly deserted. “Hullo”, Shovan Lal said, greeting me in Hindi. “Hullo”, I replied as a few men around him moved aside to let me come to him. “These are my friends”, Shovan Lal added waving his hand over the group. “What do they have to say about my working with them here in Connaught Circus?” “Well”, Shovan Lal replied, pulling a face. Just then one of the younger men started speaking very fast in a strange dialect I could not easily follow. This was taken up by an older man and in a few minutes four others joined in. When they stopped talking, Shovan Lal, who had been quiet all this time, translated for me. The Union was having trouble with the authorities. They had refused to grant a license to the Shoeshines, although hawkers could apply for one. So in effect, polishing shoes on the pavement was illegal, like begging, and one had to depend on the goodwill of the policeman. The head of the Shoeshines’ Union knew some English but obviously someone with better knowledge of the language would be of great help. So, though most of group was against letting me in, they had reluctantly agreed to give me a chance provided I helped out with the correspondence. I literally jumped for joy and gave Shovan Lal a close hug. “They also say,” he added, “that we take a collection for you to buy the box and the rest of the materials. So you can keep the five rupees to buy food and other things till you begin to earn a little. And after a few weeks you can pay back the money for the box.” A toffee tin was passed around and a little over seven rupees was collected that evening. “We will get more tomorrow, “Shovan Lal said, “when the rest are here. You know there are thirty of us who work in Connaught circus.” The group dispersed and I went home with Shovan Lal that night.

### Lesson 10: Noise: How it Affects Our Lives

title: 'Noise: How it Affects Our Lives'

**10.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
What is noise? Any unpleasant sound is noise. It’s something we don’t like. It’s something that makes us cover our ears. The wail of a fire engine, a clap of thunder, the screech of a car’s tyres when the brakes are put on suddenly. How much sound is too much? At what level does sound become noise? Well today sound can be measured scientifically. The level of sound is measured in decibels. A decibel meter is used to register sound. Zero decibel is equal to the faintest sound heard by the human ear. A decibel meter in a quiet bedroom may register around 35 decibels. In a classroom during a quiet period it may register around 50 decibels. This level is comfortable on the ears. It is said that most people speak in a range between 45 and 75 decibels. Noise damages ears at 85 decibels. Hearing loss can begin when the noise level goes above 100 decibels, and actual pain is felt at 140 decibels. Some people, however, may experience pain at a lower level. Noise pollutes our environment just as much as smoke, foul water, dirty air and litter. It can cause illness and deafness. The human body never gets used to noise. It continues to react even though a person thinks he or she has become used to all the surrounding noises. For instance, Naseer who lived in an apartment on a busy street often boasted that he could sleep through any kind of noise. He claimed he just didn’t hear it. Well, Naseer could sleep through the roar of traffic and the blare of a television set in the next apartment, but he didn’t know that while he slept his body was reacting to the stress of the noise. A doctor in West Germany, after studying the effects of noise, concluded that sounds heard by persons when they are asleep can cause danger to their hearts and blood vessels. Maybe this was the reason why Naseer had headaches. Noise causes the blood vessels in the brain to expand. It brings on pain. Another doctor was researching the effects of loud music by talking to players in a rock band. One of them called out, “Speak up, Doctor, we can’t hear you”. The doctor discovered that all the players suffered from some hearing loss and two of them were partly deaf. The noise level of the music they played ranged from 105 to 115 decibels and they played for more than eleven hours every week. It’s the length of time, often hours and hours, of being exposed to loud noises that damages the sensitive part of the inner ear. What can you do? If you start thinking about the harmful effects of noise, you will become quieter yourself. There are many steps you can take to cut down noise. At school, for instance, instead of slamming books on a desk, place them quietly. Instead of walking noisily through the halls, walk quietly. At home use one mechanical device at a time. In other words, don’t run the vacuum cleaner and the washing machine at the same time. Turn down stereos, radios, tape recorders, and televisions sets. And don’t turn on more than one at the same time. Many cities have passed strong anti-noise regulations. Progress is being made towards a quieter world, but if we want to get rid of the rattle, bang, and roar all round us, we have to start being quiet ourselves.

### Lesson 11: My Elder Brother

title: 'My Elder Brother'

**11.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
I was only a year and some months younger than Valodya; we grew up, studied and played together. No distinction of elder and younger was made between us. But just about the time I am speaking of I began to realize that I was no companion for him, either in age, in interests or in ability. It even seemed to me that Valodya himself was aware of his superiority and was proud of it. This idea (it may have been a wrong one) was inspired by my vanity which suffered every time I came in contact with him. He was better than me in everything; at lessons, in arguments and in manners, and all this took me farther from him and caused me moral anguish which I could not understand. When Valodya was given a tucked linen shirt for the first time I was unhappy for not having a shirt like that. I am sure I would have felt happier if I was convinced that every time he arranged his collar it was not done to annoy me. What tormented me most was that it sometimes seemed to me Valodya understood what was going on inside me but tried to hide it. But perhaps my sensitiveness and tendency to analyse deceived me in this case. It may be Valodya did not feel at all as I did. He was impulsive and his enthusiasm in different hobbies did not last long. He would suddenly develop a passion for pictures, himself take up painting, spend all his money buying them and beg them of his drawing-master, of papa and of grandmamma. Then it would be a craze for curios to decorate his table, collecting them from every room in the house, or a mania for novels which he obtained on the sly and read all day and night. I could not help being impressed by his hobbies but I was too proud to imitate him and too young and not independent enough to choose a hobby for myself. But there was nothing I envied so much as Valodya’s happy large heartedness which showed itself most strikingly when we quarreled. I always felt that he was behaving well but I could not do likewise. Once when his passion of ornaments was at its height, I went up to his table and accidentally broke an empty bright-coloured little scent bottle. “Who asked you to touch my things?” demanded Valodya coming into the room and seeing how I had upset the symmetry of the different treasures on his table. “ And where is the scent bottle? You must have ……..” “I knocked it over by accident and it broke. What does it matter?” “Do me the favour-never dare touch my things again”, he said, putting the pieces of broken flask together and looking at them sorrowfully. “And you please don’t issue orders” I retorted, “that’s all.” And I smiled, though I did not feel in the least like smiling. “Yes, its nothing to you but it does matter to me,” pursued Valodya, jerking his shoulder, a gesture he had inherited from papa. “ He goes and breaks it and then laughs, the nasty little brat!” “I am a little brat; and you’re big but you’re stupid.” “I am not going to quarrel with you,” said Valodya, giving me a slight push, “go away.” “Don’t push!” “Get away!” “Don’t push, I tell you!” Valodya took my word and tried to drag me away from the table; but I was beside myself by now; I got hold of the leg of the table and tipped it over. “There now!” And all his china and glass ornaments crashed to the floor. “You disgusting little boy!” cried Valodya, trying to save some of his falling treasures. “Well, now it is all over between us,” I thought as I left the room, “we have quarreled for good.” As soon as afternoon lessons were over I left the room. I was too scared, uncomfortable and ashamed to be alone with my brother. After our history lesson in the evening I took my exercise books and started towards the door. As I passed Valodya, though I wanted to go up to him and make friends I scowled and put on an angry expression. At that moment Valodya raised his head and, with a meaningful smile, looked me full in the face. Our eyes met and I knew that he understood me; but some irresistible feeling made me turn away. “ Nicky!” he said in a most natural voice without a scrap of pathos. “Don’t be cross any more. Forgive me if I offended you.” And he held out his hand. Something that came higher and higher seemed to be pressing my chest and stopping my breath but this only lasted a second; tears came to my eyes and I felt better. “Forgive … m-me, Val-dya,” I stammered, squeezing his hand. Valodya looked at me as if he could not make out at all why there should be tears in my eyes.

The young man threw the hammer and the chisel to the ground and cried: “I’m leaving you, father, I’m leaving you and your work. Look what it has brought us”. He spread out his arms, looked at the small, congested dark room, the slabs of stone and marble stacked up in one corner, the cot covered with heaps of used clothes. The paint of white-washed walls has come off. “Look what it has brought us - nothing, nothing!” the young man repeated in anger. “This kind of work just doesn’t pay.” The old man stared at his son. His voice, though trembling, had not lost its usual gentleness. “It is not the money alone that matters, son. It is the service, our service to God.” “Father, times have changed, and so has the stone mason’s work. You cannot live carving sculptures for temples only. Come on, father! You have to mass produce like all the other people in Agra.” The lines around the old man’s mouth tightened. He said, “No, my son. This is the work I have learnt from my father and he had learnt from his father. We have kept up this tradition for hundreds of years. And I hoped you would continue our work.” “No, father, there is so much more money in candle stands, paper-weights, ashtrays and plates for tourists”. The young man walked out of the room angrily. The old man sat before the half finished marble statues of Radha and Krishna. He dropped his hands into his lap and closed his eyes. He was praying. He did not seem to listen to the hesitant, “goodbye”, the son called out from the door. He sat still. “Masterjee. Masterjee” Salim, the servant boy entered the workshop. His voice was filled with concern. He held a cup of tea in his hand. The old man lifted his head. He had a pale face and looked old and tired. He said, “Salim, soon I’ll be the last stone mason here, as everyone has gone to Agra. Look, Gopal my son has gone too. Now I’ll have to finish this sculpture all by myself”. The old man looked at the orphaned boy Salim and said, “ I have very little strength. I can’t work with the chisel the way I used to. Carving takes too long a time. I have to finish the work and I will.” The boy offered tea to the man and said, “Please drink this. It will do you good. Yes, I know you will finish this work.” The old man sighed and picked up the chisel and the hammer. He loved his work and didn’t want to change it for any other work in the world. For days together the man worked continuously without taking any rest. His one desire was to finish the sculpture, which would be his last. He worked till his hands began to tremble and his shoulders started to ache. His arms grew heavy and his eyes grew tired. And then he couldn’t see anymore. At that moment Salim returned. He saw the old man and asked him to eat some food. The old man whispered, “I am not going to finish it. I will not complete it. If Gopal was here, it would have been different, although he was not a good sculptor. He had difficulty in carving the face and hands properly. There was something missing in his fingers, and that something can’t be taught.” Salim whispered, “Because it comes from somewhere deep inside you.” “You are right Salim.” And then the old man added, “And if you don’t have it inside you, then you’d better go to Agra and mass produce ashtrays for the tourists.” The boy asked Masterjee to eat, and after feeling a little better the old man picked up his hammer and chisel again and worked till late in the night. In those days he prayed a lot. Now he prayed for help and strength and he prayed for his son. In the early hours of the morning the chisel fell from the old man’s hand, the hammer dropped to the ground and he fainted. When the old man opened his eyes he found himself on the cot in his bedroom covered by a light cotton blanket. From the workshop the chipping around of the chisel reached his ears. He listened. Had he heard correctly? He could hear it again, strong blow of the hammer on the top of a chisel. Gopal! He was back. Gopal had returned. He should help him. They would finish the statue together. Weakly he walked to the door. Gopal! He was about to say, but the words froze on his lips. “No!” he wanted to cry out. “Stop the Work!” But he couldn’t move and stood staring at the young stone carver working at the face of the statue. It wasn’t his son Gopal, but Salim, his servant. The old man watched stunned, unable to speak. Anger gave way to a feeling of admiration, “Hai Ram,” the old man whispered. Finally when the weakness had left him, he walked over to the boy, put his hand on his shoulder. “Salim.” The boy started. He turned, looking up at his master. “ I…I….only want to help,” whispered the boy. I…. “I’ll learn, if you teach me, Masterjee! I have been practicing secretly. For almost two years, in the quarry. I know. I should not have done this. But isn’t this different, Masterjee? This is sculpture, isn’t it?” The old man pulled the boy’s head against his shoulder and whispered, “There is nothing I can teach you, my son. Go ahead, you have it in your heart. I know you will be one of the best stone masons India will ever have.”

**14.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
A relative and I became fond of smoking. Not that we saw any good in smoking, or were very fond of the smell of a cigarette. We simply imagined a sort of pleasure in emitting clouds of smoke from our mouths. My uncle had the habit, and when we saw him smoking, we thought we should copy his example. But, we had no money. So we began to collect stubs of cigarettes thrown away by my uncle. The stubs, however, were not always available and could not emit much smoke either. So we began to steal coins from the servant’s pocket money in order to purchase Indian cigarettes. In the meantime we heard that the stalks of a certain plant were porous and could be smoked like cigarettes. We got them and began this kind of smoking. But we were far from being satisfied with such things as these. Our want of independence began to upset us. It was unbearable that we should be unable to do anything without the permission of our elders. At last, in sheer disgust, we decided to commit suicide! But how were we to do it? From where were we to get the poison? We heard that dhatura seeds were an effective poison. Off we went to the jungle in search of these seeds, and we got them. Evening was thought to be an auspicious hour. We went to Kedarjee Mandir, put ghee in the temple lamp, had the darshan and then looked for a lonely corner. But our courage failed us. Supposing we were not instantly killed? And what was the good of killing ourselves? Why not rather put up with the lack of independence? But we swallowed two or three seeds nevertheless. We dared not take more. Both of us fought shy of death and decided to go to Ramji Mandir to compose ourselves, and to dismiss the thought of suicide. I realised that it was not as easy to commit suicide as to think about it. The thought of suicide ultimately resulted in both of us bidding good-bye to the habit of smoking stubs of cigarettes and of stealing the servant’s coppers for the purpose of smoking. Ever since I have grown up, I have never desired to smoke and always regard the habit of smoking as barbarous, dirty and harmful. I have never understood why there is such a rage for smoking throughout the world. I cannot bear to travel in a compartment full of people smoking. I become choked. But much more serious than this was the theft I was guilty of a little later. I stole the coins when I was twelve or thirteen, possibly less. The other theft was committed when I was fifteen. In this case I stole a bit of gold out of my brother’s armlet. This brother had run into a debt of about twenty-five rupees. He had on his arm an armlet of solid gold. It was not difficult to clip a bit out of it. Well, it was done, and the debt cleared. But this became more than I could bear. I resolved never to steal again. I also made up my mind to confess it to my father. But I did not dare to speak. Not that I was afraid of my father beating me. No. I do not recall his ever having beaten any of us. I was afraid of the pain that I should cause him. But I felt that the risk should be taken; that there could not be a cleansing without a confession. I decided at last to write out the confession, to submit to my father, and ask for his forgiveness. I wrote it on a slip of paper and handed it to him myself. In this, not only did I confess my guilt, but I asked adequate punishment for it, and closed with a request to him not to punish himself for my offence. I also pledged myself never to steal in future. I was trembling as I handed the confession to my father. He was then confined to bed. His bed was a plain wooden plank. I handed him the note and sat opposite the plank. He read it through, and tears trickled down his cheeks, wetting the paper. For a moment he closed his eyes in thought and then tore up the note. He had sat up to read it. He lay down again. I also cried. I could see my father’s agony. If I were a painter I could draw a picture of the whole scene today. It is still so vivid in my mind. Those tears of love cleansed my heart, and washed my sin away. Then I could read in it nothing more than a father’s love; but today, I know that it was pure Ahimsa. When there is such Ahimsa, it changes everything it touches. There is no limit to its power. This kind of sublime forgiveness was not natural to my father. I had thought that he would be angry, say hard things, and strike his forehead. But he was so wonderfully peaceful, and I believe this was due to my clean confession. A clean confession, combined with a promise never to commit the sin again, is the purest type of repentance. I know that my confession made my father feel absolutely safe about me, and increased his affection for me beyond measure.

### Lesson 15: My Vision for India

**15.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
I have three visions for India. In 3000 years of our history people from all over the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds. From Alexander onwards the Greeks, the Turks, the Moguls, the Portuguese, the British, the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours. Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture and their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them. Why? Because we respect the freedom of others. That is why my FIRST VISION is that of FREEDOM. I believe that India got its first vision of this in 1857, when we started the war of Independence. It is this freedom that we must protect and nurture and build on. If we are not free, no one will respect us. We have 10 percent growth rate in most areas. Our poverty levels are falling. Our achievements are being globally recognised today. Yet we lack the self-confidence to see ourselves as a developed nation, self-reliant and self-assured. Isn’t this incorrect? MY SECOND VISION for India is DEVELOPMENT. For fifty years we have been a developing nation. It is time we see ourselves as a developed nation. We are among top five nations in the world in terms of GDP. I have a THIRD VISION. India must stand up to the world. Because I believe that unless India stands up to the world, no one will respect us. Only strength respects strength. We must be strong not only as a military power but also as an economic power. Both must go hand-in-hand. My good fortune was to have worked with three great minds. Dr.Vikram Sarabhai, of the Dept. of Space, Professor Satish Dhawan, who succeeded him and Dr. Brahm Prakash, father of nuclear material. I was lucky to have worked with all three of them closely and consider this the great opportunity of my life. I was in Hyderabad giving this lecture, when a 14 year-old girl asked me for my autograph. I asked her what her goal in life is. She replied: I want to live in a developed India. For her, you and I will have to build this developed India. You must proclaim India is not an under-developed nation; it is a highly developed nation. You say that our government is inefficient. You say that our laws are too old. You say that the municipality does not pick up the garbage. You say that the phones don’t work, the railways are a joke, the airline is the worst in the world, and mails never reach their destination. You say that our country has been fed to the dogs and is the absolute pits. You say, say and say. What do you do about it? Dear Indians, I am echoing J.F.Kennedy’s words to his fellow Americans to relate to Indians ……. “ASK WHAT WE CAN DO FOR INDIA AND DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE TO MAKE INDIA WHAT AMERICA AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE TODAY.”

**18.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
To the little girl he was a figure to be feared and avoided. Every morning before going to work he came into her room and gave her a casual kiss, to which she responded with “Goodbye, father”. And oh,the glad sense of relief when she heard the noise of the carriage growing fainter and fainter down the long road! In the evening when he came home she stood near the staricase and heard his loud voice in the hall. “Bring my tea into the drawing-room...Hasn't the paper come yet? Mother, go and see if my paper's out there-and bring me my slippers.” “Kezia”, mother would call her, “if you are a good girl you can come down and take off father’s boots.” Slowly the girl would slip down the stairs, more slowly still, across the hall, and push open the drawing-room door. By that time he had his spectacles on and looked at her over them in a way that was terrifying to the little girl. “Well, Kezia, hurry up and pull off these boots and take them outside. Have you been a good girl today?” “Id-d-don’t know, father.” “You d-d-don’t know? If you stutter like that mother will have to take you to the doctor.” She never stuttered with other people–had quite given it up – but only with father, because then she was trying so hard to say the words properly. “What's the matter? What are you looking so wretched about? Mother, I wish you teach this child not to appear on the brink of suicide … Here, Kezia, carry my tea cup back to the table carefully.” He was so big – his hand and his neck, especially his mouth when he yawned. Thinking about him alone was like thinking about a giant. On Sunday afternoons grandmother sent her down to the drawing – room to have a “nice talk with father and mother”. But the little girl always found mother reading and father stretched out on the sofa, his handkerchief on his face, his feet on one of the best cushions, sleeping soundly and snoring. She sat on a stool, gravely watched him until he woke and stretched, and asked the time – then looked at her. “Don’t stare so, Kezia. You look like a little brown owl.” One day, when she was kept indoors with a cold, the grandmother told her that father’s birthday was next week, and suggested she should make him a pin-cushion for a gift out of a beautiful piece of yellow silk. Laboriously with double cotton, the little girl stitched three sides. But what to fill it with? That was the question. The grandmother was out in the garden, and she wandered into mother’s bedroom to look for 'scraps'. On the bed table she discovered, a great many sheets of fine paper, gathered them up, tore them into tiny pieces, and stuffed her case, then sewed up the fourth side. That night there was a hue and cry in the house. Father’s great speech for the Port Authority had been lost. Rooms were searched-servants questioned. Finally mother came into Kezia’s room. “Kezia, I suppose you didn’t see some papers on a table in our room?" “Oh yes,” she said, “I tore them up for my surprise.” “What” screamed mother “Come straight down to the dining-room this instant.” And she was dragged down to where father was pacing to and fro, hand behind his back. “Well?” he said sharply. Mother explained. He stopped and stared at the child. “Did you do that?” “N-n-no,” she whispered. “Mother, go up to her room and fetch down the damned thing- see that the child’s put to bed this instant.” Crying too much to explain, she lay in the shadowed room watching the evening light make a sad little pattern on the floor. Then father came into the room with a ruler in his hands. “I am going to beat you for this,” he said. “Oh, no, no”, she screamed, hiding under the bed clothes. He pulled them aside. “Sit up,” he ordered, “and hold out your hands. You must be taught once and for all not to touch what does not belong to you.” “But it was for your b-b-birthday.” Down came the ruler on her little, pink palms. Hours later, when the grandmother had wrapped her in a shawl and rocked her in the rocking-chair, the child clung to her soft body. “What did God make fathers for?” she sobbed. “Here’s a clean hanky, darling. Blow your nose. Go to sleep, pet; you’ll forget all about it in the morning. I tried to explain to Father but he was too upset to listen tonight.” But the child never forgot. Next time she saw him she quickly put both hands behind her back and a red colour flew into the cheeks. The MacDonalds lived next door. They had five children. Looking through a hole in the fence the little girl saw them playing ‘tag’ in the evening. The father with the baby Mao on his shoulders, two little girls hanging on to his coat pockets ran round and round the flower beds, shaking with laughter. Once she saw the boys turn the hose on him-turn the hose on him-and tried to catch them laughing all the time. Then it was she decided there were different sorts of fathers. Suddenly, one day, mother became ill, and she and grandmother went to hospital. The little girl was left alone in the house with Alice the cook. That was all right in the daytime, but while Alice was putting her to bed she grew suddenly afraid. “What’ll I do if I have a nightmare?” she asked. “I often have nightmares and then Grannie takes me into her bed– I can't stay in the dark–It all gets ‘whispery’…..”. “You just go to sleep, child,” said Alice, pulling off her socks, “and don't you scream and wake your poor Pa.” But the same old nightmare came–the butcher with a knife and a rope, who came nearer and nearer, smiling that dreadful smile, while she could not move, could only stand still, crying out, “Grandma! Grandma!”. She woke shivering to see father beside her bed, a candle in his hand. “What’s the matter?” he said. “Oh, a butcher–a knife-I want Grannie.” He blew out the candle, bent down and caught up the child in his arms, carrying her along the passage to the big bedroom. A newspaper was on the bed–a half-smoked cigar was near his reading-lamp. He put away the paper, threw the cigar into the fire-place, then carefully tucked up the child. He lay down beside her. Half asleep still, still with the butcher’s smile all about her it seemed she crept close to him, snuggled her head under his arm, held tightly to his shirt. Then the dark did not matter; she lay still. Tired out, he slept before the little girl. A funny feeling came over her. Poor father, not so big, after all–and with no one to look after him. And everyday he had to work and was too tired to be a Mr. Macdonald. …She had torn up all his beautiful writing… She stirred suddenly, and sighed. “What’s the matter?” he asked her. “Another dream?” “Oh,” said the little girl, “my head’s on your heart. I can hear it going. What a big heart you've got, father dear.”

**20.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
Recycling rubbish not only helps save money-it also helps the environment. We lessen the pollution that is created by burning rubbish and we save valuable resources. Western countries waste a great deal of the earth’s resources. For example, in the USA about 75,000 trees are felled every week just for printing the Sunday edition of the New York Times. Recycling used paper would easily save these trees. Many countries encourage recycling and new technology allows more waste to be reused. Most of the world’s rubbish can be reused-paper, metals, glass, and even some plastics. Plastic is one of the most difficult substances to recycle, because it comes in so many varieties. Some plastic bottles, for example, consist of six layers of different types of plastic, each designed to give the bottles certain qualities - shape, strength, flexibility. And as yet there is no simple way to turn an old plastic bottle into a new one. Plastic scrap can only be turned into a product of lower quality - a plastic might be cleaned, cut into very very tiny pieces and used to stuff seat cushions, a mixture of plastic waste can be recycled into plastic ‘timber’ and used to make durable fencing. But a lot of plastic waste still has to be thrown away. Metals are different. Any car on the road today will consist, in part, of earlier cars that have been scrapped and recycled into new steel and other metals. The more valuable the metal, like gold and silver, the more it pays to recycle it. Aluminum is worth recycling because extracting it from Bauxite consumes a huge amount of electricity. Since most Aluminum today is recycled, the energy used to make Aluminum has fallen by a quarter since the early 1970’s. Glass is also worth recovering. The most sensible method is to use glass bottles as often as possible. In countries which still use milk bottles, the average bottle makes about 30 trips to and from the dairy. Broken glass known as ‘cullet’ can also be recycled, and many western countries have bottle banks into which used bottles can be thrown. Usually there are payments. Bottle banks depend on people’s goodwill. The success of bottle banks varies widely from country to country. The Swiss and Dutch recover 50 percent of their glass, while in Britain only 12 percent is recovered. In India of course, we sell our bottles which are then reused. Glass is best separated by colour, since cullet of mixed colours can be used only to make green glass. Broken glass can be remelted in furnaces and then it can easily be shaped into new bottles or other objects. Half the world’s waste consists of paper. Many countries import waste paper rather than new pulp for their paper mills. The waste is pulped, cleaned and bleached to remove most of the ink and dirt, before it is turned into new paper in the same way as wood pulp or rags. Japan now makes half its paper by recycling. It is true that in India we generally avoid waste. However, as we enter the twenty-first century, we are beginning to imitate some of the wasteful habits of the western countries. This is something that all of us need to think about.

**24.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
The people of Gujarat were mostly farmers. They reared cattle but remained poor. Despite their hard work, they always remained in want. The poor plight of these farmers moved the heart of the Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He was determined to bring prosperity into their lives. So, he decided to organise them into a co-operative force and provide them with a steady source of income. This task was assigned to Mr. Tribhuvandas Patel. He united the disorganised farmers and started a co-operative dairy unit. This system of co-operative effort eliminated the middlemen who harassed and exploited the ignorant farmers. But Tribhuvandas Patel found it difficult to compete with a British dairy in Mumbai. At this point of time it was kind providence that brought a young energetic, intelligent and ambitious Indian engineer, trained in America, to work at the dairy research institute, Anand. Tribhuvandas sought this clever young man’s assistance. This young man was none other than Verghese Kurien. He helped Tribhuvandas to set up a processing plant. This marked the birth of Amul and the rest is history. Shall we trace the history and the man who made this history? It tells how he strove incessantly in order to expand Amul milk unit. It also tells us about how through his relentless efforts, the dream of Vallabhbhai Patel was fulfilled. Dr. Verghese Kurien was born in Calicut on 26th November 1921. He got his first degree in physics and he studied B.E. Mechanical Engineering at the University of Madras. He went on a scholarship to the USA and passed M.S degree with distinction. He was also very good at cricket, tennis and boxing. When he returned to India, he joined the Government Dairy at Anand in Gujarat as a Dairy Engineer. But he felt it was not a challenging job for him. So he agreed to help Mr. Tribhuvandas Patel in setting up a milk processing plant. This was how the Amul Dairy came into existence in Gujarat. Dr. Verghese Kurien developed the Amul Dairy Unit into the largest co-operative dairy in India. As a result of Dr. Kurien’s relentless efforts, the poor milk producers were protected from being exploited. The farmers came to appreciate the spirit of co-operation in addition to acquiring marketing skills. He introduced various reforms in the administration of Amul Dairy. He proposed to distribute half of its profits to the milk producers as dividend. Dr. Kurien’s reforms improved the rural economy considerably. This proves the saying, “The woman who owns a buffalo celebrates Diwali every day.” Dr. Kurien made India the largest milk producer of the world. Dr. Kurien established the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) and designed the “Operation Flood Programme.” Dr. Kurien may rightly be called the “Architect of Modern Dairy Industry” and the “Father of the White Revolution”. He has been honoured with very high civilian awards such as Padmashri and Padmabhushan. His achievements were recognised internationally and he was awarded the presitigious Ramon Magasaysay Award for community leadership. Dr. Kurien has succeeded in keeping the wolf from the doors of our farmers. His efforts have made the Indian farmer healthy, wealthy, cheerful and wise. Thanks to Dr. Kurien that our children today are blessed with quality milk, butter and cheese, not to forget the chocolates and ice cream.

**26.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
Ustad Bismillah Khan was undoubtedly a gem that India is proud of. This shehnai maestro of India received the Bharat Ratna in 2001. He had earlier been awarded the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan. He was thus the recipient of all the top-four civilian awards. Born on March 21, 1916 in Dumraon, Bihar, he was the second son of Paigambar Khan and Mitthan. His family had a musical background; his ancestors were musicians in the court of the princely state of Bhojpur (now in Bihar). Bismillah Khan was named Qamaruddin to sound like his elder brother's name – Shamsuddin. However, when his grandfather Rasool Baksh Khan saw him as a baby, he uttered the word ‘Bismillah’, and hence he came to be known as Bismillah Khan. His father was a musician in the court of Maharaja Keshav Prasad Singh of Dumraon. At the age of six, Bismillah Khan moved to Varanasi (earlier known as Banaras), where his maternal uncle, Ali Baksh 'Vilayatu' was the official shehnai player at the famous Vishwanath Temple. Ali Baksh noticed that Bismillah was a keen music learner, so he took him under his tutelage. Thus, Bismillah Khan started learning to play the shehnai from his uncle. Ali Baksh played shehnai at the Vishwanath Temple and practised in one of the temple rooms at Balaji Ghat. Bismillah Khan’s routine was to follow his uncle the whole day to both the temples, and practise for hours together – without any play time, school and sometimes even regular meals. Bismillah Khan religiously practised the shehnai and attained perfection in a very short time. The flowing waters of the River Ganga inspired him to improvise and invent 'ragas' that were earlier considered to be beyond the range of shehnai. He often played the shehnai at the Vishwanath Temple on the banks of River Ganga. He was also a devotee of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of wisdom and arts. Ustad Bismillah Khan was perhaps single-handedly responsible for making the shehnai a famous and popular musical instrument and bringing it into the mainstream Indian classical music. His concert at the All India Music Conference (1937) in Calcutta brought shehnai into the limelight, and was hugely appreciated by music lovers. Despite the fame that he got, Bismillah Khan always remained simple. He never accumulated wealth and other material possessions. He lived in humble surroundings in the holy city of Varanasi. His favourite mode of transport was the cycle rickshaw. Such was his love for his city and motherland that he declined an offer of permanent citizenship for settling in the United States of America. He monopolised shehnai recitals in the post-independence era and through them, kept the legacy of classical music alive. Ustad Bismillah Khan always believed that music would survive even if the world perished. He also believed in Hindu-Muslim unity and spread the message of brotherhood through his music. He often said, “Music has no caste.” Bismillah Khan had the rare honour of playing the shehnai on the eve of India's independence in the year 1947. At the age of ninety, Bismillah Khan breathed his last. In honour of this great musician, the Government of India declared a one-day national mourning on his death. He was buried along with his shehnai in Varanasi under a neem tree with a 21-gun salute from the Indian Army.

**27.1 LET US READ THE TEXT**
‘You are no beauty! Can’t talk, can’t sing, can’t dance!’
With these words Aunt Ruby would taunt the unfortunate parakeet, who glared morosely at everyone from his ornamental cage at one end of the long veranda of Granny’s bungalow in north India. In those distant days, almost everyone – Indian or European – kept a pet parrot or parakeet, or ‘lovebird’ as some of the smaller ones were called. Sometimes these birds became great talkers, or rather mimics, and would learn to recite entire mantras (religious chants) or admonitions to the children of the house, such as ‘Padho, beta, padho!’ (‘Study child study!’) or for the benefit of boys like me, ‘Don’t be greedy, don’t be greedy!’. These expressions were, of course, picked by the parrot over a period of time, after many repetitions by some member of the household who had taken on the task of teaching the bird to talk. But our parrot refused to talk. He’d been bought by Aunt Ruby from a bird-catcher who’d visited all the houses on our road, selling caged birds ranging from colourful budgerigars to chirpy little munnias and even common sparrows that had been dabbed with paint and passed off as some exotic species. Neither Granny nor Grandfather were keen on keeping caged birds as pets, but Aunt Ruby threatened to throw a tantrum if she did not get her way–and Aunt Ruby’s tantrums were dreadful to behold! Anyway, she insisted on keeping the parrot and teaching it to talk. But the bird took an instant dislike to my aunt and resisted all her blandishments. ‘Kiss, kiss!’ Aunt Ruby would coo, putting her face close to the bars of the cage. But the parrot would back away, its beady little eyes getting even smaller with anger at the prospect of being kissed by Aunt Ruby. And on one occasion it lunged forward without warning and knocked my aunt’s spectacles off her nose. After that Aunt Ruby gave up her endearments and became quite hostile towards the poor bird, making faces at it and calling out ‘can’t talk, can’t talk, can’t sing, can’t dance!’ and other nasty comments. It fell upon me, then ten years old, to feed the parrot, and it seemed quite happy to receive green chillies and ripe tomatoes from my hands, these delicacies being supplemented by slices of mango, for it was then the mango season. This also gave me an opportunity to consume a couple of mangoes while feeding the parrot! One afternoon, while everyone was indoors enjoying a siesta, I gave the parrot its lunch and then deliberately left the cage door open. Seconds later, the bird was winging its way to the freedom of the mango orchard. At the same time Grandfather came to the veranda and remarked, ‘I see your aunt’s parrot has escaped!’. ‘The door was quite loose,’ I said with a shrug. ‘Well, I don’t suppose we’ll see it again.’ Aunt Ruby was upset at first, and threatened to buy another bird. We put her off by promising to buy her a bowl of goldfish. ‘But goldfish don’t talk!’ she protested. ‘Well, neither did your bird,’ said Grandfather. ‘So we’ll get you a gramophone. You can listen to Clara Cluck all day. They say she sings like a nightingale.’ I thought we’d never see the parrot again, but it probably missed its green chillies, because a few days later I found the bird sitting on the veranda railing, looking expectantly at me with its head cocked to one side. Unselfishly I gave the parrot half of my mango. While the bird was enjoying the mango, the end of the affair. The parrot became a frequent visitor to the garden and veranda, and whenever it saw Aunt Ruby it would call out, ‘You’re no beauty, you’re no beauty! Can’t talk, can’t sing, can’t dance!’. The parrot had learnt to talk after all!

### Lesson 1: Snake Bite

**Literary Focus & Themes:**
This story introduces Raja, an innocent, adventurous young boy who likes to meddle with creatures like snakes and bees.

### Lesson 24: Co-Operate and Prosper

**Literary Focus & Themes:**
This lesson explains the economic benefits and social importance of forming a **co-operative** (exemplified by the **Amul Dairy** in Gujarat) and the value of self-governance.

**Key Learning Points:**
*   **Problem of Exploitation:** Historically, hard-working cattle farmers remained poor because **middlemen** bought their milk cheaply and sold it for huge profits, exploiting and harassing the farmers.
*   **The Solution (Co-operative):** Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel dreamed of eliminating middlemen and bringing prosperity by organizing farmers into a collective group.
*   **The White Revolution:** Tribhuvandas Patel, with the critical assistance of the talented engineer **Dr. Verghese Kurien**, established the processing plant that became Amul Dairy. Kurien's relentless efforts expanded Amul, ushering in the White Revolution, which empowered farmers, gave them a steady income, and distributed profits (dividends) back to them.

**Grammar and Language Skills:**
*   **Pronouns:** Using different types of **pronouns** effectively: Personal (*he, she*), Reflexive (*himself, ourselves*), and Possessive (*mine, yours, his*).
*   **Non-finites:** Using **infinitives** both *with* and *without* 'to'.
*   **Writing:** Describing a **Process** (e.g., the journey of milk or chocolate making) using passive voice and sequence markers.

### Lesson 25: Once Upon a Time

**Literary Focus & Themes:**
This poem, addressed by a father to his son, is a **satire** (criticism using irony/humour) on the **artificiality and loss of innocence** in modern adult society. The poet yearns for his natural, childlike honesty.

**Key Learning Points:**
*   **Shift from Genuine to Fake:** The poet remembers a time when people laughed "with their hearts and laugh with their eyes". Now, they only laugh "with their teeth" while their eyes are "ice-block-cold".
*   **Conditionality of Relationships:** Modern relationships are formal and dependent on status or wealth. People perform meaningless pleasantries ("feel at home," "come again") but their "left hands search" for the person's economic status.
*   **Conforming to Society:** The father admits he has learned to "wear many faces like dresses" and perform routine, emotionless actions (like the "fixed portrait smile") just to fit into society.
*   **The Desire to "Unlearn":** The father desperately wants to **"unlearn all these muting things"** and relearn how to laugh genuinely, as his current laugh in the mirror reveals only his teeth, "like a snake's bare fangs" (a simile suggesting falseness and danger). He asks his son to teach him.

**Language Skills:**
*   **Literary Devices:** Identifying elements of **satire** and implied comparison.
*   **Simile/Imagery:** Explaining the imagery created by similes like *ice-block-cold eyes* and *snake's bare fangs*.

### Lesson 27: The Parrot Who Wouldn’t Talk

**Literary Focus & Themes:**
A humorous story by Ruskin Bond conveying the message to be **kind to pets,** treat them with **love and patience,** and respect their dislike for **captivity**.

**Key Learning Points:**
