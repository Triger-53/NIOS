## Module I: Introduction to Business, Industry, and Commerce

### 1. Human Activities
Activities performed by human beings are called human activities, and they are broadly divided into two categories:

1.  **Economic Activities:** Activities performed with the objective of **earning money** (e.g., a doctor attending patients in their clinic, a tailor stitching clothes for customers, a factory employee working for wages).
2.  **Non-Economic Activities:** Activities performed not to earn money but to gain satisfaction, discharge social obligations, maintain physical fitness, or for recreation (e.g., listening to the radio, providing relief to flood victims, a mother stitching clothes for her children).

| Basis | Economic activities | Non-economic activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Earning motive. | Social and Psychological motive. |
| **Outcome** | Lead to creation of wealth and assets. | Lead to satisfaction and happiness. |
| **Expectation** | Expect profits or money income. | Don't expect profits or money income. |

### 2. Types of Economic Activities (Occupations)
Economic activities undertaken on a regular basis to earn a livelihood are generally referred to as occupations. They are classified into three categories:

1.  **Business:** An occupation involving the regular production and sale of goods and services for money, with the primary objective of **making a profit** (e.g., manufacturing, trading, banking).
    *   *Characteristics:* Deals in goods/services, requires regular exchange (not isolated transactions), requires investment, aims at profit, and involves risk and uncertainty of income.
2.  **Profession:** An occupation requiring **specialized knowledge and training** to pursue, and is regulated by a professional body with a code of conduct. The primary objective is to **provide service** (e.g., doctor, lawyer).
3.  **Employment:** An occupation where a person works regularly for another person and receives wages or salary in return, according to the terms and conditions set by the employer (e.g., government servants, factory workers).

### 3. Business Objectives
Any desired outcome that a business organization wants to achieve over a specified period is a business objective. Objectives are classified as:

| Type of Objective | Description and Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Economic** | Aimed at earning profit and the activities necessary to sustain profit, such as **creation of customers**, **continuous innovations**, and **best possible use of resources**. Profit is the lifeblood of business. |
| **Social** | Objectives desired for the benefit of society. Includes production/supply of **quality goods** and services, **adoption of fair trade practices** (avoiding hoarding/black-marketing), and **contribution to general welfare** (e.g., running schools/hospitals). |
| **Human** | Aimed at the well-being and fulfillment of employees and backward people. Includes **economic well-being** (fair remuneration/incentives), **social and psychological satisfaction** of employees (making jobs interesting), and **development of human resources** (training/development). |
| **National** | Objectives aligning business goals with national aspirations. Includes **creation of employment**, **promotion of social justice**, production according to national priority, **contribution to country revenue** (paying taxes honestly), and **self-sufficiency/export promotion**. |
| **Global** | Objectives related to operating in the world market. Includes raising the **general standard of living**, **reducing disparities among nations** (through investment in developing countries), and making available **globally competitive goods and services**. |

### 4. Industry and Commerce
Business activities are broadly classified into:
1.  **Industry:** Concerned with the **production** of goods and materials (e.g., extracting, processing, manufacturing, construction).
    *   *Types:* Primary (nature-oriented, e.g., agriculture), Genetic (reproduction/multiplication of plants/animals), Extractive (drawing goods from soil/air/water, e.g., mining), Manufacturing (transforming raw material into finished product), Construction (buildings, dams), and Service (hotel, tourism).
2.  **Commerce:** Concerned with the **distribution** of goods, ensuring free and uninterrupted flow from manufacturer to consumer. It includes **Trade** and **Aids to Trade**.
    *   **Trade:** Buying and selling (Wholesale or Retail).
    *   **Aids to Trade (Auxiliaries):** Activities facilitating smooth flow of goods: Transportation, Warehousing, Insurance, Advertising, and Banking.

### 5. E-Commerce
E-commerce (Electronic Commerce) means the buying and selling of goods and services over computer networks like the Internet.

*   **Categories of E-Commerce**:
    *   **B2B (Business-to-Business):** Companies doing business with each other (e.g., manufacturers selling to wholesalers).
    *   **B2C (Business-to-Consumer):** Businesses selling to the general public (e.g., online retail, sometimes called e-tailing).

*   **Advantages:** Wider choice for customers/market for businessmen, improved customer services, quick response to needs, cost saving/price reduction, and market information access.

**1. Social Responsibility of Business**
The concept of social responsibility discourages businessmen from adopting unfair means to earn profit, such as black-marketing, hoarding, adulteration, tax evasion, and cheating customers. Instead, it encourages earning profit through judicious management, providing better working/living conditions for employees, offering better products and after-sales service to customers, and simultaneously controlling pollution and conserving natural resources. It is important to note that social responsibility is not charity; an activity is not considered discharge of social responsibility if it is harmful to society in the course of business activities.

**Responsibilities Towards Different Interest Groups (Stakeholder Obligations):**
Business interacts with various interest groups, including owners, investors, employees, suppliers, customers, competitors, government, and society.

*   **Owners/Investors:** Responsibilities include running the business efficiently, proper utilization of capital and resources, growth/appreciation of capital, ensuring safety of investment, regular and fair return on capital invested, regular payment of interest, and timely repayment of the principal amount.
*   **Employees:** Responsibilities include timely and regular payment of wages/salaries, proper working conditions and welfare amenities, opportunity for better career prospects, job security and social security (like provident fund/pension benefits), better living conditions (like housing/canteen), and timely training and development.
*   **Customers:** Responsibilities include ensuring products/services meet customer needs and are qualitative, maintaining regularity in supply, offering reasonable and affordable prices, informing customers about product advantages/disadvantages/usage procedure, providing proper after-sales service, settling grievances quickly, and avoiding unfair means like under-weighing or adulteration.
*   **Government:** Responsibilities include setting up units according to government guidelines, payment of fees, duties, and taxes regularly and honestly, conforming to pollution control norms, and not indulging in corruption through bribing or other unlawful activities.
*   **Society/Community:** Responsibilities include helping weaker and backward sections, preserving/promoting social/cultural values, generating employment, protecting the environment, conserving natural resources/wildlife, promoting sports/culture, and providing assistance for developmental research.

**2. Environmental Pollution and the Role of Business**
Environmental pollution refers to contamination of the environment by various substances that adversely affect living and non-living matter.

*   **Types of Pollution:** Environmental pollution is categorized into Air, Water, and Land Pollution. Noise Pollution (unwanted sound causing irritation) is also noted, caused by machines, loud speakers, generators, vehicles, etc., which can lead to loss of hearing, headache, irritation, and high blood pressure.
*   **Business Contribution to Pollution:** Business is a major contributor to all types of pollution through the emission of gas/smoke from manufacturing plants, use of machines/vehicles contributing to noise pollution, deforestation for plant setup, disposal of wastes/effluents into rivers/canals, and mining/quarrying activities.
*   **Role of Business in Control:** Business can help control environmental pollution in three ways:
    1.  **Preventive Role:** Taking steps to avoid further damage by following government regulations.
    2.  **Curative Role:** Rectifying damage already done (e.g., planting trees to reduce air pollution near industrial areas).
    3.  **Awareness Role:** Making employees and the public aware of the causes and consequences of pollution so they voluntarily protect the environment.

## Module II: Forms of Business Organisation

This module examines the different structures businesses adopt based on ownership, liability, and management. The primary forms are Sole Proprietorship, Partnership, Joint Hindu Family (HUF), Co-operative Societies, and Joint Stock Companies.

| Feature | Description | Key Points from Sources |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Membership & Agreement** | Minimum two members (maximum 10 in banking, 20 in others). | Requires an agreement detailing profit/loss sharing and duties. |

| **Limitations** | Unlimited liability is a major drawback, limited capital due to member restriction, and non-transferability of share without consent. |

#### Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
LLP (governed by the LLP Act, 2008) is a modern corporate vehicle offering the flexibility of a partnership combined with **limited liability**. An LLP is a body corporate and a legal entity separate from its partners, offering perpetual succession. Liability of partners is limited to their agreed contribution, and they are generally not liable for the unauthorized actions of other partners.
